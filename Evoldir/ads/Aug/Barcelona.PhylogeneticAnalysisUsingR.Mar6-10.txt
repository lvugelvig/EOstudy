Dear Colleague,

Registration is open for the fourth edition of the course PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
USING R, March 6th-10th, 2017.

INSTRUCTORS: Dr. Emmanuel Paradis (Institut de Recherche pour le D¨¦veloppement,
France) and Dr. Klaus Schliep (University of Massachusetts, USA).

More information:
http://www.transmittingscience.org/courses/phylogeny/phylogenetic-analysis-using-r/

This course is for biologists dealing with the analysis of multiple molecular
sequences at several levels: Populations, species, clades, communities. These
biologists address questions relative to the evolutionary relationships among
these sequences, as well as the evolutionary forces structuring biodiversity at
different scales. The objectives are: (i) to learn the theorical bases
phylogenetic analysis, (ii) to know how to choose a strategy of molecular data
analysis at the inter©\ or intraspecific levels, (iii) to be able to initiate a
phylogenetic analysis starting from the files of molecular sequences until the
interpretation of the results and the graphics. The software used for this
course will be centered on the R language for statistics. This will include the
use of specialized packages particularly ape, phangorn, and adegenet.

Requeriments: Knowledge of multivariate statistics, phylogenetics and molecular
evolution. User level of R.

PLACE:  Facilities of the Centre of Restauraci¨® i Interpretaci¨® Paleontologica,
Els Hostalets de Pierola,  Barcelona (Spain).

Organized by: Transmitting Science, the Institut Catal¨¢ de Paleontologia M.
Crusafont and the Centre de Restauraci¨® i Interpretaci¨® Paleontologica de Els
Hostalets de Pierola.

Places are limited and will be covered by strict registration order.
