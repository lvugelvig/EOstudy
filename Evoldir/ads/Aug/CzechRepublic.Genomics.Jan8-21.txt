Workshop Overview:
The Workshop on Genomics consists of a series of lectures, demonstrations
and computer laboratories that cover various aspects of genomics focusing
primarily on the analysis of modern sequencing data. Faculty are chosen
exclusively for their effectiveness in teaching theory and practice. The
course is designed for established investigators, postdoctoral scholars,
and advanced graduate students. Scientists with strong interests in
the uses of modern sequence data, analytical methods, and the use of
modern sequence data to study non-model organisms, variant detection and
analysis, genome visualization tools and related areas are encouraged
to apply for admission. Lectures and computer laboratories total ~90
hours of scheduled instruction. No programming experience is required.

Topics to be covered include:
- Sequencing technologies
- Genomics study design
- Manipulation of sequence data using the command-line and quality
  assessment and control techniques
- Analyzing genomic data in the "cloud" using Amazon Web
  Services (AWS)
- Assembly and alignment: basic analyses used for de novo and re-
  sequencing studies
- The use of next-generation sequence data to study non-model organisms
- RAD (Restriction site Associated DNA) sequence analysis
- Metagenome analysis (with WGS and amplicon)
- Evolutionary genomics

Co-directors: Naiara Rodr√≠guez-Ezpeleta, Dag Ahren, Scott A. Handley,
Konrad Paszkiewicz, and Karin Rengefors
