Legendary population geneticist Professor Jim Crow would have turned
100 years of age this year. To honor his life and legacy, a special
event will be hosted by the Laboratory of Genetics at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison on Friday, September 23, 2016.

In the afternoon, an outstanding set of speakers will describe how
Professor Crow's research transformed the fields of evolution and
genetics. In the evening, we will swap stories over dinner, listen to
a keynote address from Professor Dan Hartl (who obtained his Ph.D. with
Crow), and share personal remembrances.

As students of evolution, you won't want to miss this celebration. Please
visit http://www.supportuw.org/calendar/crow100/ to register.

I hope you can join us. If you cannot, please consider sharing a
written tribute to Professor Crow (it can be just a few sentences)
for the event. You can send your tribute to payseur@wisc.edu. Thank you.
