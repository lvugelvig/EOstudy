We are pleased to announce a symposium on the Genetics of Adaptation.

Our goal is to bring together a broad representation of evolutionary
biologists, geneticists and developmental biologists who study the
evolutionary drivers and genetic and developmental mechanisms of key
adaptations in nature. Participants will be evolutionary biologists who
study the genetics and developmental biology of adaptations, or
geneticists and developmental biologists whose work informs ideas in
population genetics and evolutionary theory/genomics. Together, we will
aim to synthesize recent developments in evolutionary biology,
population genetics, ecological genetics, evo-devo, and developmental
tools and genomics technologies, which have fueled explosive growth in
understanding molecular genetic and developmental bases of adaptations
even in non-model organisms.

We invite advanced PhD students, postdocs and young faculty to submit
abstracts for oral and poster presentations. Abstract submission
deadline: 15 September 2016

Symposium dates: 28 November to 2 December 2016
Venue: National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore,
India.

Sponsored by: The Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), Simons
Centre for the Study of Living Machines, Department of Biotechnology
(DBT, Govt. of India), and The Company of Biologists.
