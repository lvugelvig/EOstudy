Dear all

Contributions are welcome to a symposium we are organising within the
International Congress on Invertebrate Morphology, in Moscow, 18-23
August 2017.

The symposium "Morphological Lazarisation: when new technology
brings life to historical specimens" will bring together researchers
that use old specimens, re-examined with new technology or just new
perspectives. (Examples include 3D scanning/ tomography, electron
microscopy,  DNA barcoding, UV light and fluorescence, etc.) This is a
celebration of the enduring usefulness of museum collections, and how
material collected long ago can find new unanticipated purposes.

We would love to have you join us!
