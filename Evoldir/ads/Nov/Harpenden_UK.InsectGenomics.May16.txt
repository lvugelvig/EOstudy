Dear all,

I'd like to let the community know that the registration has opened for 
the /Insect Genomics Special Interest Group meeting/ of the /Royal 
Entomological Society/.

The development of the new sequencing technologies has placed the field 
of genomics at the heart of biological research. Many genomes have 
already been published and many more are being generated. This abundance 
of genomic data is proving to be fundamental to a wide range of research 
areas including functional genomics, the evolution of diversity and 
insect management.The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the latest 
developments in the field of genomics and how they are being applied in 
entomology. We will bring together researchers with different 
backgrounds to promote the exchange of ideas and explore collaborations 
that can further advance insect science.

We welcome presentations from researchers at all stages of their careers 
working on insect genomics and the development of bioinformatics tools, 
as well as from those applying these methods to study questions ranging 
from insect ecology and evolution to management and control.

We are really excited to have Nicola Nadeau (University of Sheffield), 
Chris Bass (Unversity of Exeter) and Luke Alphey (The Pirbright 
Institute) as invited speakers.

It will take place on the 16th of May 2017 at Rothamsted Research, 
Harpenden, UK. The registration fee is 15 to cover for lunch, 
tea/coffee and a wine/refreshment reception during the poster session.

The deadline for abstract submission is the 16th of March 2017 and 
deadline for registration is the 2nd of May 2017.
