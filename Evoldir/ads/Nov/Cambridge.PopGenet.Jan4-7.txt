meeting now covers most areas of evolutionary genetics and genomics. This
meeting will be a celebration as it is the 50th in the series.

Plenary speakers are: Doris Bachtrog, Nancy Moran, Eske Willerslev and
Howard Ochman

Registration includes a conference dinner in St John's College and is
excellent value! As little as 180 for non-residential student, GenSoc
