Species in the Age of Discordance

University of Utah Department of Philosophy Annual Conference Series

March 23rd 25th 2017 Salt Lake City, Utah

The *University of Utah* *Department of Philosophy* cordially invites
submissions of abstracts or prospecti (up to 1000 words) for paper and
poster presentations at our upcoming conference =93Species in the Age
of Discordance=94. Submissions should be prepared for blind review and
uploaded at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3D3Dsitaod2017. Please
be sure to indicate whether your submission is for a paper or a
poster. The submission deadline is Nov. 15 Dec 1st, 2016.

Biological lineages move through time, space, and each other. As they
do, they diversify, diverge, and grade away from and into one another.
One result of this is genealogical discordance, i.e., the lineages of a
biological entity may have different histories. We see this on numerous
levels, from microbial networks, to holobionts, to population-level
lineages.

The focus of this project is whether and how genealogical and other sorts
of biological discordance impact our views on species. Other kinds of
relevant discordance might include geographic discordance due to habitat
fragmentation and human mediated dispersal of species in new environments,
discordant government policies which affect populations that straddle
or migrate across international borders, and discordant use of language
or theoretical terms between researchers in different disciplines.

To promote a cross-disciplinary examination of this question,
investigators from a variety of fields will participate in a series
of interdisciplinary meetings. This includes researchers working on
phylogenetics, microbiology, symbiosis, population genetics, taxonomy,
philosophy, and history.

The Utah meeting is the first of three meetings on this topic.  Follow up
sessions are tentatively planned for the 2017 Evolution Meeting (Portland,
OR) and the 2017 ISHPSSB Meeting (Sao Paulo, Brazil). The Utah meeting
will be a mix of invited and refereed papers and posters.
