In this intensive 17 days course, students will learn how to survive in a
Linux environment, get hands-on experience in two widely used programming
languages (Python and R), and statistical data analysis. The classes will
be given by experts in the field and consist of lectures and exercises
with the computer. The aim of the course is to provide the students with
the necessary background and skills to perform computational analyses
with a focus on solving research questions related to genomics and
evolution. The philosophy of the course will be =93learning by doing=94,
which means that the computational skills will be taught using examples
and real data from evolutionary biology for the exercises. During the
course, students will also propose projects of their own interest and
perform them as final projects in small groups under the supervision
of a teaching assistant.  This summer school is open for students
from all countries and targeted toward PhD students and postdocs of
evolutionary biology or related research fields with no or little
programming experience who want to become proficient in computational
evolutionary biology in a couple of weeks.

The course takes place at the University of Leipzig.
