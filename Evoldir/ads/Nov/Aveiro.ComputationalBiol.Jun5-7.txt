AIMS:

AlCoB aims at promoting and displaying excellent research using string and
graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization to deal with problems in
biological sequence analysis, genome rearrangement, evolutionary trees,
and structure prediction.

Previous events were held in Tarragona, Mexico City, and Trujillo.
 
The conference will address several of the current challenges in
computational biology by investigating algorithms aimed at:

1) assembling sequence reads into a complete genome,
2) identifying gene structures in the genome,
3) recognizing regulatory motifs,
4) aligning nucleotides and comparing genomes,
5) reconstructing regulatory networks of genes, and
6) inferring the evolutionary phylogeny of species.
 
Particular focus will be put on methodology and significant room will
be reserved to young scholars at the beginning of their career.

VENUE:

AlCoB 2017 will take place in Aveiro, an industrial city with an
important seaport on the Atlantic Ocean, and known as "the Portuguese
Venice" due to its network of canals. The venue will be the Department
of Mathematics of the University of Aveiro, Campus Universitário de
Santiago, 3810-193 Aveiro.

SCOPE:
 
Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not
limited to:

Exact sequence analysis
Approximate sequence analysis
Pairwise sequence alignment
Multiple sequence alignment
Sequence assembly
Genome rearrangement
Regulatory motif finding
Phylogeny reconstruction
Phylogeny comparison
Structure prediction
Compressive genomics
Proteomics: molecular pathways, interaction networks
Transcriptomics: splicing variants, isoform inference and quantification, differential analysis
Next-generation sequencing: population genomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics
Microbiome analysis
Systems biology
