ESEB SYMPOSIUM ON INVERSIONS & SUPERGENES

Dear Colleagues:

We would like to invite you to attend and/or contribute to the ESEB
symposium

"The Evolutionary Significance of Chromosomal Inversions" [S18]

which will take place at the 16th Congress of the European Society for
Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), in Groningen, Netherlands, 20-25 August 2017.

INVITED SPEAKERS:
Mark Kirkpatrick (Austin)
Michael Fontaine (Groningen)

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION:
Chromosomal inversions represent common structural mutations that result
in the reversal of gene order in the corresponding  state, they have been
associated with evolutionary processes that involve reduced recombination
and gene flow such as speciation and sex chromosome evolution. Inversions
might also play a pivotal role in adaptation. For example, inversions
might act as adaptive "supergenes" by keeping together coadapted gene
complexes or by protecting locally adapted alleles from maladaptive gene
flow. Consistent with adaptive effects, several inversion polymorphisms
exhibit strong, persistent frequency clines and have been associated with
fitness-related traits. Despite almost 100 years of research on inversions
since their discovery by Sturtevant in 1921, we are still far from
fully understanding the mechanisms whereby inversion polymorphisms are
maintained in natural populations and how selection acts on them. Recent
advances in population genetic theory and genomics are now beginning to
shed light on these fundamental questions. With this symposium we seek
to foster a discussion between theorists and experimentalists about the
causes and consequences of inversion evolution.

Organizers:
Martin Kapun and Thomas Flatt (University of Lausanne)

We invite submissions for oral and/or poster contributions; we are
interested in both empirical and theoretical work addressing the
evolutionary causes and consequences of chromosomal inversions.

The deadline for abstract submission is 10 January 2017.

We are very much looking forward to seeing you in Groningen!

Martin and Thomas.
