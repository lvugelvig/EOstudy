Join us for the 7th Meeting of Poeciliid Biologists at the University
of Oklahoma in Norman May 24 – 26 2017 (http://poeciliid2017.com/).

Each and everybody interested in any aspects of the biology of livebearing
fishes should attend. Poeciliids are used as model species for many
different questions including (and not limited to), evolution, ecology,
genomics, genetics, cancer research, morphology, life-history evolution,
systematics, taxonomy, and behavior. This meeting is totally open to
every aspect of livebearing fishes – and even if you are interested
in livebearing organisms per se, this will be a good meeting for you.

For any questions relative to the conference please use the following
e-mail address: poeciliid@ou.edu.

See you in Norman!
