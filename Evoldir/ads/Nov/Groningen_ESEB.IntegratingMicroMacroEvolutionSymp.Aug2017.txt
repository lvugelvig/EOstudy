We are pleased to invite you all to submit abstracts for our symposium
"Integrating micro- and macroevolution" planned for European Society
for Evolutionary Biology meeting in Groningen, Netherlands 20-25th of
August 2017.

 [S29] Integration of micro- and macroevolution

Evolutionary biology studies the patterns and processes that shape
biodiversity over long and short timescales. Traditionally microevolution
focused on within-species dynamics in a short temporal perspective,
while macroevolution deals with both within- and between species
patterns and processes over longer periods of time. Although many
macroevolutionary patterns still lack explanations that follow from
microevolutionary theory and observations, exiting new developments
now allow both micro- and macroevolutionary approaches to converge
on understanding biological variation within the context of genomic
organization, historical constraint, contingency as well as elucidating
biotic and abiotic drivers of evolutionary change. The increasing genetic
resolution provided by next-generation-sequencing technology impacts
studies of both micro and macro-evolution; phylogenetic analyses are
now increasingly based on many markers and include genome organization,
and functional traits are commonly being linked to causal genetic
determinants. It is now also possible to combine palaeontological and
neontological data in the same analysis framework. In this symposium, we
will explore insights from such new developments and their potential for
determining the research agenda for evolutionary biology. Contributions
shall address fundamental questions regarding the integration of macro-
and microevolution, for instance how can macroevolutionary studies inform
hypotheses of microevolutionary change and vice versa?
