POPULATION GENOMICS WORKSHOP

January 16th-18th 2017
University of Sheffield, UK

This course will be held at the NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility at the
University of Sheffield and introduce participants to a variety of
population genomics analyses for large next generation sequencing (NGS)
datasets. It will include discussion on single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) calling and filtering options, an introduction to population genomics
statistics using the PopGenome R package, examining genetic structure,
Fst-based analyses such as outlier detection/genomic islands of divergence,
and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS).

The majority of the course will comprise practical computer sessions,
giving participants hands-on experience in these analyses. We will perform
these on the high performance computing cluster at Sheffield and computers
will be provided. Prior experience with the Linux environment and basic
command line tools would be advantageous.

There is no charge for the course, and successful applicants will be
provided with accommodation for two nights and up to 100 towards travel
costs to Sheffield.

The application closing deadline is at 5pm on Monday 28th November.
