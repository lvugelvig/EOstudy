GIS analysis with QGIS for biologists
From Monday 6th to Friday 10th February 2017
in Berlin, Germany
http://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course5/

Instructors:
Dr Paolo Cavallini and Matteo Ghetta

Overview
QGIS is the most popular and reliable Open Source GIS in the world. QGIS
is currently used in Universities, Public Facilities and private offices.
Born in 2002 as a simple layer viewer in the last 5 year more than 200
developers all over the world contributes to the source code making QGIS
the standard of the GIS.  The course is intended for biologists with no
experience of GIS but also for those who want to switch from another GIS
software to QGIS.  The course will be focused on practical examples so
that the students will be able to load and process their own data and
perform both simple and complex spatial analysis.

Course materials (example data, presentations, additional files) will
be provided to participants.

Intended audience
Students and researchers with absolutely no GIS experience will learn
the basic GIS system concepts and will be able to work alone with
QGIS. However, people with both GIS concept and QGIS experience will
enjoy the course. Furthermore, the course is useful to all of those
people who want to migrate from another GIS software (ArcMap, gvSIG,
GRASS, etc..) to QGIS.

Teaching format
The course is 5 full-day long. The first day a small presentation of
GIS concept will be shown. The other days practical examples and guided
exercises will be provided.

Assumed Background
Biologists can have absolutely no GIS (or QGIS) experience. GIS experts
that want refresh some GIS concept or want to discover hidden features
of QGIS are welcome!
