Please join us for a workshop titled, "Traits past, present, and future: 
Quantitative approaches to conservation and climate change biology in 
Africa" held on 6 - 8 March 2017 at the National Museums of Kenya in 
Nairobi, Kenya. This event will bring together paleontologists, 
ecologists, and quantitative biologists to discuss how data from 
paleontology, modern ecology, and conservation biology can be integrated 
to provide a comprehensive framework for monitoring and measuring 'the 
evolution of' ecosystem structure and function through space and time.
