About Galaxy:
Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical data integration and
analysis. It is deployed at large and small organizations around the world
and used in a broad range of biomedical research domains, and across the
tree of life.  Galaxy enables life science researchers to perform their own
data analysis without having to learn command line interfaces or Linux
package management.  Galaxy transparently records all analysis steps and
eases workflow reuse and sharing.
