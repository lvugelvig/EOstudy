Dear Students,

The first Global Biodiversity Genomics Conference will be held in
Washington, D.C. February 21-23, 2017 at the Smithsonian's National Museum
of Natural History.  This conference will discuss exciting topics in the
field of conservation, ecological, environmental, and diversity genomics
with a Plenary Address by E.O. Wilson.  To learn more see: (
http://biogenomics2017.org).

Are you interested in attending Biogenomics 2017 and getting a free
waiver?  Read below:

DEADLINE NEAR:

For a limited time, GIGA (Global Invertebrate Genome Alliance) will be
offering a small number of full registration waivers courtesy of the
American Genetics Association (value of $500) to qualified students who are
currently working on or have recently finished a GIGA-related Big Data
genomics or transcriptome project.  *Students should still register to the
conference website for a headcount.*

Then, to apply for the waiver, please send a project description to
the GIGA steering committee (find on the GIGA webpage - or mail to Keith
Crandall - kcrandall@gwu.edu ; Gonzalo Giribet - ggiribet@g.harvard.edu ;
Steven Haddock - haddock@mbari.org ; or Jose Lopez - joslo@nova.edu). The
committee will evaluate each summary based on merit and need.

The description should aim to be concise, no more than 1000 words that
fully describes the project details - organism, questions, goals,
genomics methods, hurdles etc.

Please include the name of your major advisor, your full contact

conference.

The deadline for receipt of the abstract is Nov 28, 2016. Please send the
project description as a Word file to one of the members above , and use
the Subject header: "*GIGA Waiver Application for the 2017 Global
