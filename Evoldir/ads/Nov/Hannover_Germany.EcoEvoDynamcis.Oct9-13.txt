Conference: Flexibility matters: Interplay between trait diversity and
ecological dynamics using aquatic communities as model systems

The conference will address trait-based ecology with a focus on
biomass-trait feedbacks and eco-evolutionary dynamics typically arising
from trophic interactions. We aim to bridge between theoretically guided
empirical field and laboratory studies and data-informed development
of theory and modelling. The meeting will provide opportunities to
exchange ideas and results with members of the DFG funded Priority
Program DynaTrait and guests through a series of contributed and invited
talks, poster sessions and small working groups. The meeting focuses on
aquatic systems, but other systems are welcome as well if results are
sufficiently generalizable. For more information and list of speakers see

The meeting will take place 9th-13th October 2017 in Hannover, Germany.
