Please, find below the first announcement for the *14th International
Conference on Ecology and Management of Alien Plant Invasions*, which will
be held in *Lisbon *between the
*4th and 8th of September, 2017.*

The aim of the EMAPI 2017 is to promote the opportunity to share findings
and experiences research, management, and policy with professionals
from around the world. Following the decision of the EMAPI Core Group in
Hawaii during the last EMAPI meeting, the 14th Ecology and Management of
Alien Plant Invasions World Congress will be held in Lisbon, from 4th to
8th September 2017.

The Congress aims to become a benchmark event, by gathering a large number
of scientists, managers and policy makers from around the world, who will
interact and explore ways to face global and regional challenges presented
by alien plant invasions, for the benefit of the present and future
generations.

A mid-conference field trip will offer first-hand experience with
Portuguese coastal plant invasions, while also allowing extensive
opportunities for networking. For this international meeting, we are
expecting to bring together ~ 300 active researchers, managers and policy
makers. A special discount registration will be available to students.
