'Bioinformatics for geneticists and biologists (BIGB02)

Delivered by Dr. Nic Blouin and Dr Ian Misner

http://www.prstatistics.com/course/bioinformatics-for-geneticists-and-biologists-bigb02/

This course will run from 3rd - 7th July 2017 at SCENE Field Station, 
Loch Lomond, Glasgow

OVERVIEW
The handling of large datasets has become intractable without some level 
of bioinformatic literacy. Many biologists find that there is a steep 
learning curve to develop the confidence required to explore their 
genomics datasets effectively. This bioinformatics short course includes 
a rich collection of hands-on instruction and lectures specifically 
intended to help novice users become comfortable with a range of tools 
currently used to analyse next-generation data.

INTENDED AUDIENCE
The course is aimed at anyone interested in learning bioinformatics 
tools needed for handling large genomic datasets.

Course content is as follows

Monday 3rd - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00
Module 1: Linux.
Linux is taught on the first day, this takes the entire day. Once you 
get through this portion you will be on your way to completing your own 
NGS analysis. We have created a workbook for this portion of the course. 
This is a step-by-step, or in the case, command-by-command, Linux guide. 
We complete each command as a class and discuss and review issues along 
the way.

Tuesday 4th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00
Module 2: RNAseq.
We will cover two of the more popular tools in this workshop, The Tuxedo 
package & Trinity. Outcomes; Confidence to design effective RNAseq 
experiments. Knowledge of NGS sequencing platforms and their differing 
applications, ability to analyze Illumina data for quality and 
contamination. Proficiency to implement the Tuxedo package to analyze an 
RNAseq dataset.Create publication ready graphics with cummeRbund and 
EdgeR.

Wednesday 5th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00
Module 3: Assembly.
Whether you have a reference genome or are working with de novo samples 
there are some basic tools and practices that we cover to help assist 
you in your genome project. In this module we will cover the basic 
metrics you should review when doing assembly as well as best practices 
to consider in your own project. Outcomes; Take raw reads through a 
complete assembly process. Working knowledge of different assembly 
issues/challenges. The effect of assembly settings on assembly outcomes.

Thursday 6th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00
Module 4: Annotation.
We will use MAKER and Blast2GO and annotate the genome we assembled in 
the assembly module. Outcomes; Understand the differences between 
functional and structural annotations. Train MAKER to improve structural 
annotations. Understand how MAKER improves with more evidence and 
training; visualize structural annotations. Apply functional annotations 
with Blast2GO.

Friday 7th - Classes from 09:00 to 16:00
Module 5: Python.
Why Python? In truth it doesn't matter what coding language you learn 
but you should learn one. Python has a very straightforward syntax that 
is easy to understand.In this module we will utilise the clearly 
explained training examples from Python for Biologists. Outcomes; 
Understand Python language syntax. Create scripts to answer biological 
problems & parse and analyse BLAST outputs using custom Python code.
