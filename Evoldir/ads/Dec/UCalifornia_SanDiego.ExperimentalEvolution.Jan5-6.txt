Dear All,

Many recent advances in evolutionary biology have been achieved through the
development of experimental approaches in systems ranging from molecules to
multicellular organisms. To discuss this topic, please join us on Jan 5 and
6, 2017, for a two-day Californian Experimental Evolution Symposium on UCSD
campus in La Jolla, CA.

The list of speakers and a tentative schedule can be found here:
