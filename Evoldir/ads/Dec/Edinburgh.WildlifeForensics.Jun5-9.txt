Dear colleagues,

The Society for Wildlife Forensic Science is an international
organisation promoting the use of forensics in law enforcement across
wildlife crime. I'm writing to draw your attention to the Society's 2017
meeting that will be held from 5-9th June in Edinburgh, UK, which may
be of particular interest to Evoldir subscribers working on population
genetics of species involved in the illegal wildlife trade.

Forensics has been receiving increasing attention within the wildlife law
enforcement community, with inclusion in numerous high level national
and intergovernmental strategies, as well as the development of new
laboratory facilities around the world.

The meeting will bring together the world's leading wildlife forensic
scientists and includes a special 1-day International Symposium where we
will bring together Policy, Enforcement and Scientific experts to discuss
the use of forensics in relation to transnational crime, IUU fishing,
illegal timer trade and national wildlife crime.  This event will be
opened by the Scottish government Cabinet Secretary for Environment,
Climate Change and Land Reform, Ms Roseanna Cunningham, with a keynote
address from the Secretary General of CITES, Mr John Scanlon.

Please visit the website for more information and to register your
attendance (https://www.wildlifeforensicscience.org/2017-meeting/),
discounts apply for early registration (until 31st January 2017). Spread
the word to colleagues you think may be interested in this meeting.

Many thanks,

Lucy
