We are pleased to announce that the 5th Annual Astyanax International
Meeting for Cavefish will be held March 12-15, 2017, in Santiago de
Quer=E9taro, Mexico.

The meeting will feature many great talks about cavefish and adaptation
to novel and extreme environments in general. We are happy to announce
that Katie Peichel will be our keynote speaker to present her work how
sticklebacks adapt to their environment. The meetings are usually very
informal with a limited number of participants and enough time for social
interactions to give students the ability to interact with faculty and
vice versa. Student prices are subsidized by the faculty rates and very
affordable. Mexican resident students can even attend for free.

Our venue will be the lovely Hotel Misi=F3n Juriquilla Quer=E9taro. This
hotel offers first class accommodation in a renovated eighteenth century
farmhouse north of the city of Queretaro, surrounded by gardens and
buildings that evoke the colonial Mexico.

The meeting will be followed by an optional caving trip to the Sierra
del Abra biosphere reserve, March 15-18, 2017 for a limited number
of participants.
