We would like to announce the Ecological Immunology Workshop 2017 on:

Insect immunity: genomics, microbiome, applications

  28th August to 1st September 2017 in Blossin (close to Berlin), Germany.

This workshop will bring together researchers interested in ecological
immunology with a focus on insects, and with diverse scientific
backgrounds ranging from molecular biology to ecology. The hallmark
of these workshops, started in 2001, is the open atmosphere fostering
free exchange by keeping it an affordable, small conference (100
participants). The format consists of eighteen invited speakers,
contributed talks and a dedicated poster. Long breaks provide plenty
of opportunity for informal exchange. Past workshops have initiated new
collaborations and ideas focusing on frontier research that has not been
published. The premises are basic but in a beautiful location conducive
to the success of the meeting. We will be located at a lakeside, which
at this time of the year offers great swimming and canoeing, and a small
private bar at the harbour [http://www.blossin.de].
