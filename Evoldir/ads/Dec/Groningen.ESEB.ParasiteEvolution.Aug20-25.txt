ESEB Symposium on "PARASITE EVOLUTION IN RESPONSE TO TREATMENT"

Dear Colleagues, 

We would like to invite you to attend or contribute to the ESEB symposium
[S1] Parasite evolution in response to treatment at the 16th Congress
of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology in Groningen, The
Netherlands, 20-25 August 2017.

INVITED SPEAKERS: 
Pleuni Pennings (San Francisco State University)
Sebastian Bonhoeffer (ETH Zürich) 

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION:
Parasites evolve in response to our attempts to control them. Drug
resistance, vaccine-driven strain replacement, and parasite life-history
shifts are all examples of evolutionary mechanisms by which the benefits
of our interventions are reduced. Understanding the drivers and limits
of parasite evolution in response to interventions is essential for
predicting evolutionary consequences in advance and defining best
practices for disease management. This symposium will highlight work
that seeks to generate this understanding and offer new insight for the
management of infectious diseases. In particular, we welcome submissions
of novel theory and empirical work investigating the coupling between
epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics, the consequences of different
spatio-temporal treatment strategies, and the short- and long-term
evolution of parasite traits.

SYMPOSIUM ORGANIZERS:
Sébastien Lion (CÉFÉ, Montpellier, France) 
Nicole Mideo (University of Toronto)

ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 
The deadline for abstract submission is 10 January 2017. Submit abstracts
online at http://www.eseb2017.nl/call-for-abstracts/

Looking forward to seeing you in Groningen!
