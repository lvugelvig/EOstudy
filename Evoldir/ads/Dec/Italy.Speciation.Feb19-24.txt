The full program is now available for SPECIATION 2017, a Gordon Research
Conference (GRC) dedicated exclusively to speciation research:

https://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=16903

The conference - the world's largest of its kind - will be held at the
Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort & Spa in Italy during the week of
February 19-24, 2017. For the first time, the conference will be preceded
by a two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), co-chaired by Amanda Hund
and Laurel Symes, which offers unique opportunities for graduate students
and early-career scientists to learn and get involved at the forefronts
of modern speciation research.

The GRC conferences on speciation raise to a trans-Atlantic level a
tradition of international conferences on speciation research that was
initiated by the European Research Networking Programme 'Frontiers
of Speciation Research'. The three conferences held thus far, in
2010, 2013, and 2015, have helped facilitate bridge-building between
disparate approaches to speciation research and have attracted hundreds
of participants from all facets of speciation research.

Registration for SPECIATION 2017 will continue until the venue's capacity
is filled. At the time of writing, we can make only a few additional
acceptances before we have to waitlist applicants so please apply soon
if you are hoping to join us.

With many thanks and best wishes,

Åke Brännström & Rebecca Safran
