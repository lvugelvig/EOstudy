CONFERENCE OVERVIEW:

The population genomics of fungal and oomycete pathogens is a rapidly
growing area of research. New datasets, new sequencing methodologies
and new analytical methods are enabling a deeper understanding of the
evolutionary processes driving the emergence of fungal and oomycete
pathogens. This conference aims to enrich our understanding of the
processes driving the evolution of plant, animal and human pathogens,
with an over-riding goal of identifying the genomic changes responsible
for adaptation to novel hosts and environments. A secondary goal will
be to determine how the relevant genes (and their underlying functions)
vary along ecological/agronomic gradients associated with host
specialization, including quantitative adaptation to host resistance.
The conference will be oriented around genome-based approaches,
including; 1) using population genomics to understand pathogen
emergence and host specialization, 2) using genome-wide association
studies to identify key genes and genomic regions associated with
pathogen local adaptation, 3) using population genomics to understand
pathogen divergence/speciation, 4) developing new analytical methods
for population genomic analyses.
