Course Biodiversity and Plant Evolution
organized by Helena Cotrim and Manuela Sim-Sim | January 23-27, 2017@ Lisbon,
Portugal

Objectives: On completion of the course, the students shall have acquired
the following knowledge and understanding:
        Describe the main evolutionary acquisitions on groups of the
        plant kingdom and its adaptive significance.

-       Comprehend the modern plant phylogeny and its sources of information.
-       Explain the underlying evolutionary mechanisms of diversity and
        speciation in the plant kingdom.
-       Describe the variety of pollination syndromes, reproductive
        systems and population structures present in the plant kingdom,
        and explain the mechanisms underlying this diversity.
-       Explain and critically analyse how the genetic diversity and
        evolutionary potential of plant populations are influenced by
        phenomena like phenotypic plasticity, seed banks, hybridization,
        polyploidy and postglacial colonization history.
-       Formulate hypotheses and propose methods when studying
        evolutionary phenomena in wild plant species.

Course Practical Course on Phylogenetics organized by Octavio Paulo|
January 30 -February 3 2017 @ Lisbon, Portugal

Objectives: Phylogenetics is one of the scientific areas of Biology
that has grown fast and evolved in methodological terms in the last
years. Its applications go from the studies of the evolution of species
and populations to the least expected, as the study of the origin of
the AIDS virus or seasonal cycles of the flu. The course is aimed at
students and professionals that intend to get started in phylogenetic
analysis as well as researchers already with some experience wanting
to deepen or update their knowledge in the field. The course consists
of theoretical classes as well as hands-on practical sessions using
software. Participants are encouraged to bring their own sequence data
for analysis.

Course Applied Methods in Community Ecology and Functional Ecology by
Paulo A. V. Borges and François Rigal - February 13-17 2017 @ Lisbon,
Portugal

OBJECTIVES: This five-days intensive course is mostly a practical
course offering an overview on different community ecology and
macroecological methods and software. These will include all steps
of a research project, from the optimal sampling of communities to
process inference from large-scale patterns of taxon, phylogenetic and
functional diversity. Specific topics will be: (1) alpha, beta and
gamma diversity; (2) estimating diversity from incomplete sampling;
(3) partitioning taxonomic beta diversity; (4) community-assembly rules,
(5) functional and phylogenetic diversity, (6) null models, (7) rarity
and species abundance distribution. Finally, students will be asked to
present own data and case studies.
