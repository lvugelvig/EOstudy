It is my pleasure to announce the 2017 Guarda summer school in 
Evolutionary Biology for master and PhD students. The main aim of the 
course is to develop the skills to produce an independent research 
project in evolutionary biology.

The summer school takes place 17. - 24. June in the Swiss mountain 
village Guarda. Faculty includes Rosemary and Peter Grant (Princeton 
University, USA), Dolph Schluter (University of British Columbia, 
Canada), Sebastian Bonhoeffer (ETH-Zurich, Switzerland) and Dieter Ebert 
(Basel University, Switzerland; organizer).

The course is intended for master students and early PhD students with a 
keen interest in evolutionary biology.
