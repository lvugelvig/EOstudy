We invite you to submit an Abstract to our ESEB 2017 symposium exploring
the causes and consequences of variation in recombination rate in sexually
reproducing organisms.

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Recombination is paradoxical, it can create
novel genetic combinations that natural selection can act on, and
thus facilitate adaptation, but it can also break apart favourable
combinations of alleles. In addition, recombination can play a
critical role during meiosis, with recombination events regulated to
ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes. Thus, tight regulation of
recombination is expected, but variable rates of recombination may
be favoured in different environments or contexts. While the role
of recombination in the evolution of sex has been the focus of much
empirical and theoretical work, investigation on how conflicting selection
pressures are resolved, how recombination rate evolves, and what impact
this has on evolutionary processes within sexually reproducing organisms
has received less attention. Recent advances in DNA sequencing and
bioinformatics has provided unprecedented opportunities to characterise
variation in recombination rate. Now is a pertinent time to highlight
(i) rapidly developing approaches to estimate recombination rate in
the genomics era and (ii) our growing understanding of the causes
and consequences of variation in recombination rates; including how
recombination rate variation responds to selection, how recombination
varies between individuals, sexes, populations, species and in response
to the environment, and how recombination influences the processes of
speciation and adaptation.
