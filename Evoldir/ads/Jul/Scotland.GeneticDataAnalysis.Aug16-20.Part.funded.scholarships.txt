This course will run from 16th - 20th August, Millport Field Station, 
Ilse of Cumbrae, Scotland
This course will provide an extensive overview of exploratory methods 
for the analysis of genetic data using the R software and aim to equip 
participants with powerful resources for tackling increasingly common 
challenges in genetic data analysis.

The course is aimed at PhD students, research postgraduates, and 
practicing academics as well as persons in industry working with genetic 
data in fields such as molecular ecology, evolutionary biology, and 
phylogenetics. This course will provide a comprehensive introduction to 
various statistical approaches for the analysis of genetic data.

Course content is as follows
Day 1 Introduction to phylogenetic reconstruction
-	Lecture 1a: Reconstructing phylogenies from genetic sequence data. 
Three main approaches covered: distance-based phylogenies; maximum 
parsimony; and likelihood-based approaches.
-	Lecture 1b: Short R refresher.
-	Practical 1: Phylogenetic reconstruction using R. Three main 
approaches plus rooting a tree; assessing/testing for a molecular clock; 
and bootstrapping.
Main packages: ape, phangorn.

Day 2 Introduction to multivariate analysis of genetic data
-	Lecture 2: Key concepts in multivariate analysis. Focus on using 
factorial methods for genetic data analysis.
-	Practical 2: Basics of multivariate analysis of genetic data in R. 
Topics include: data handling, population genetic tests of population 
structure (PCA, PCoA).
Main packages: adegenet, ade4, ape.

Day 3 Exploring group diversity
-	Lecture 3: Approaches to identifying and describing genetic 
clusters. Topics include:   hierarchical clustering, K-means, 
population-level multivariate analysis (between-group-PCA, DA, DAPC).
-	Practical 3: Applying the approaches covered in morning lecture and 
emphasising their strengths and weaknesses.
Main packages: adegenet, ade4.

Day 4 Spatial genetic structure
-	Lecture 4: Discussing the origin and significance of spatial genetic 
patterns, and how to test or them.
-	Practical 4: Visualising and analysing spatial genetic data. Topics: 
spatial density estimates, Moran/Mantel tests, mapping principal 
components in PCA, spatial PCA.
-	Main packages: adegenet, glmnet.
Main packages: adegenet, glmnet.

Day 5 Using R for reproducible science
-	Lecture 5: Using R for reproducible science.
-	Practical 5: Practical session based on morning lecture
-	Main packages: knitr, Sweave, rmarkdown
-	Option to discuss own data (time permitting)
