Symposium: Investigating ecological and evolutionary processes with NGS

Global change drivers create new environmental scenarios and selective
pressures, affecting animal and plant species in various interacting
ways. Understanding how the genome of an organism evolves and copes
with environmental challenges is the main goal of Ecological and
Evolutionary Genomics (EEG). EEG involves the integration of genomic
data to the phenotype and ecosystem function of the organism. The
development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies offers an
unprecedented opportunity to understand the genetic architecture of
fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes such as migration,
foraging behavior, energetics, and communication in natural populations
as well as to identify the environmental factors that drive local
adaptation. The aim of this symposium is to discuss the promise of NGS
technologies in order to study ecological adaptation and bring together
field biologists along the molecular to theoretical continuum to
exchange ideas and perspectives.

Invited speaker, Aaron Schafer (Trent University), Canada: "Using
genomic data to infer demographic and adaptive processes in natural
populations".

The online abstracts submission for the symposium is open until the 5th
of September. This symposium is part of the XIV MEDECOS & XIII AEET
meeting, which will take place in Seville, Spain, from January 31 to
February 4, 2017.
