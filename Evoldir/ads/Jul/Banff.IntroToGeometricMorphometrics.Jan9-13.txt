Dear colleagues,

Registration is open for the course "INTRODUCTION TO GEOMETRIC
MORPHOMETRICS- 8th edition".

INSTRUCTORS: Prof. Chris Klingenberg (University of Manchester, UK)
and Dr.  Jesús Marugán (UAM, Spain).

Dates: January 9th-13th, 2017.

Place: Banff Center, Alberta, Canada (https://www.banffcentre.ca/)

More information and registration:
http://www.transmittingscience.org/courses/geometric-morphometrics/introduction-geometric-morphometrics-canada/

This course is entitled to teach the main concepts of shape analysis
based on landmark coordinates and its multivariate procedures, and
how they can be put into practice across any biological discipline in
which the phenotype (form) and its variation are the principal sources
of information.

Program:

1. Introduction: Shape, size and biological morphology.
2. Morphometric data: Equipment, landmarks, outlines and surfaces.
3. Visualizing shapes and shape changes.
4. Looking at variation: PCA.
5. Distinguishing groups: CVA and discriminant analysis.
6. Symmetry and asymmetry.
7. Morphometrics in a messy world: outliers and measurement error.
8. Regression and allometry.
9. Covariation between things: PLS.
10. Morphological integration.
11. Modularity.
12. Phylogeny and comparative methods.
13. Putting things together: Combining analyses to solve biological
    questions.
14. Presentation of group work by participants.

Please feel free to distribute this information between your colleagues
if you consider it appropriate.

With best regards

Sole
