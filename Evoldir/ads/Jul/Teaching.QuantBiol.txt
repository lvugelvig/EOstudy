Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education Synthesis (QUBES) is pleased
to offer a unique networking and professional development opportunity
from September - December 2016 for faculty interested in alleviating
math anxiety in undergraduate biology students. Quantitative skills
are essential for student success in biology, and math attitudes and
anxiety can have strong effects on both persistence and performance. This
mentoring network will familiarize faculty with background on how math
attitudes can impact Biology students, and help participants explore a
range of tools to address math attitudes and anxiety in their Biology
courses. QUBES (https://qubeshub.org) is an NSF-funded virtual center
that supports collaboration to promote quantitative biology education
at the undergraduate level.

Benefits of Participation

If you are selected, you will receive:

-Access to strategies to affect math attitudes and anxiety across general
themes such as metacognition, growth mindset, learning progressions,
model thinking, and data visualization, as well as specific ready-to-use
teaching materials in each of these areas.  Participants will choose a
focal type of intervention, and work to modify, develop, and implement
the materials in their own courses in Fall 2016.

-Access to peer mentors on lecture/classroom/lab effective tips and
strategies in small group virtual meetings every two weeks

-Support during a half-day workshop at the NABT meeting on November 3,
2016 in Denver, CO, and a reduced registration fee for the meeting

-Opportunity to develop and publish new math attitude materials on
qubeshub.org

Commitments

To qualify for this network, participants must commit to:

-Teaching a biology course in Fall 2016

-Incorporating at least one type of math attitude intervention in their
fall course

-Attending 30-min online meetings every other week

-Attending the workshop at NABT
<http://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/index.php?p=10> on Nov 3,
