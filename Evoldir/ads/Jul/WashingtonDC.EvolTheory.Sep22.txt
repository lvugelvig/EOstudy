INVITATION
to the Hierarchy Group Workshop and launch of the book "Evolutionary
Theory: A Hierarchical Perspective"

A symposium centered around the upcoming publication of the multi-authored
book,

EVOLUTIONARY THEORY: A HIERARCHICAL PERSPECTIVE (N. Eldredge, T. Pievani,
E. Serrelli and I. Tëmkin, eds.), Chicago University Press (September
2016; http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo25468890.html),

will be held at the National Academy of Science (NAS, Washington, DC)
on September 22 (Thursday) 2016, 2:30-5:00 PM.

The day after, September 23, the Northern Virginia Community College
(NOVA; Annandale, VA) will host a series of workshops with the
contributing authors of the book and several discussants to discuss issues
related to the hierarchy theory in biology in an informal atmosphere,
and to foster further collaborative work. Beside the workshops at NOVA,
an hour-long public event promoting the book is scheduled for the middle
of the day at NOVA, a more abbreviated and less formal version of the
NAS symposium.

More detailed information and tentative schedules of the events are
available on the Hierarchy Group website (www.hierarchygroup.com), where
you also find further information on the hierarchy theory of evolution.

We  extend our invitation to students, scholars, researchers, and
educators interested in evolution to attend both events and contribute to
the discussions. As the number of attendees is limited, we kindly ask you
to contact us at grouphierarchy@gmail.com to reserve your seat in advance.

We look forward to seeing you in September.

Respectfully,

Andrea Parravicini, Ph.D. & Ilya Tëmkin, Ph.D.

Perspective
