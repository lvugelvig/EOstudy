We are pleased to announce SPECIATION 2017, a Gordon Research Conference
(GRC) dedicated exclusively to speciation research. The conference ---
the world's largest of its kind --- will be held at the Renaissance
Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort & Spa in Italy during the week of February 19-24,
2017. Invited presentations and discussion sessions will cover a broad
array of timely topics in speciation research. A preliminary program
for the GRC is now posted.

The conference will be directly preceded by a two-day Gordon Research
Seminar (GRS), co-chaired by Amanda Hund and Laurel Symes, that offers
opportunities for early-career scientists to get involved at the
forefronts of modern speciation research. Participants will engage in
scientific discussions on salient topics of interest, thereby gaining
knowledge and confidence for their participation in SPECIATION 2017.

The GRC conferences on speciation raise to a trans-Atlantic level a
tradition of international conferences on speciation research that was
initiated by the European Research Networking Programme 'Frontiers
of Speciation Research'. The three conferences held thus far, in
2010, 2013, and 2015, have helped facilitate bridge-building between
disparate approaches to speciation research and have attracted hundreds
of participants from all facets of speciation research.

Registration for SPECIATION 2017 is open at
https://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=16903
and will continue until the venue's capacity is filled.

With many thanks and best wishes,
