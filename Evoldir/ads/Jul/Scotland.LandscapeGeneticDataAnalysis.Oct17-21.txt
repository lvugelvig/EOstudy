"Landscape (population) genetic data analysis using R"

Delivered by Dr. Rodney Dyer

http://prstatistics.com/course/landscape-genetic-data-analysis-using-r-lndg/

This course will run from 17th - 21st October 2016 at SCENE Field 
Station, Loch Lomond, Glasgow, Scotland
The term 'landscape genetics' has been applied studies that 
integrate ecological context and intervening landscape into population 
genetic analyses of contemporary processes such as gene flow and 
migration.  This course will cover the basics of both quantitative 
landscape ecology and population genetics, focusing on how we develop 
and evaluate spatial/genetic analyses using the R platform

Course content is as follows
Day 1
-	Spatial & Ecological Data
-	Installation & configuring R & RStudio
-	Acquiring spatial data, projections, and visualization
-	Vector and raster data

Day 2
-	Genetic markers and basic analyses
-	Genetic markers and sampling
-	Genetic distance, diversity, and structure
-	Ordination techniques based upon genetic markers

Day 3
-	Integrating spatial and genetic data
-	Barrier detection & population division
-	Resistance Modeling
-	Mantel and distance regressions
-	Remote sensing - LiDAR and Hyperspectral data

Day 4
-	Integrating spatial and genetic data
-	Spatial autocorrelation
-	Network Approaches
-	PCMN & Redundancy

Day 5
-	Adaptive Genetic Variance
-	Outliers & gradients
-	Quantitative genetics, why we should care.
-	Chromosome walking
