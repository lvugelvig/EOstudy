Hi Everyone-

We are offering a  Fall Workshop in Introductory Bioinformatics
 
Where/when:
University of Maryland
College Park, Maryland
September 15-18, 2016
 
The handling of large datasets has become intractable without some
level of bioinformatic literacy. Many biologists find that there is a
steep learning curve to develop the confidence required to explore their
genomics datasets effectively. This bioinformatics short course includes a
rich collection of hands-on instruction and lectures specifically intended
to help novice users become comfortable with a range of tools currently
used to analyze deep sequencing data.  There is no prerequisite for this
course other than a willingness to learn and to work hard throughout the
week. All workshop exercises will be implemented via VirtualBox and focus
primarily on Illumina data; however, we will also include PacBio data
during the genome assembly tutorial.  Course participation is limited to
25 students to ensure an intimate learning environment. Course tuition
is $800 and is open to graduate students, postdocs, staff, faculty,
and industry researchers on a first come basis.

application instructions at https://biodatatraining.wordpress.com

Please contact us if you have any questions or need additional info.
Hope to see you in College Park.
