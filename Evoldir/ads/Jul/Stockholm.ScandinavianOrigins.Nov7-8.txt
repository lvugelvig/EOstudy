Symposium: Origins and Natural History of the Scandinavian Biota

7-8 November 2016

Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Sweden

Scandinavia was covered by a large ice sheet during the last glacial
maximum, which means most modern-day animals, plants and humans have a
recent origin in the region. But their origins and subsequent history
have until recently remained unresolved.

The Swedish Museum of Natural History invites you to a symposium where
some of the world's leading researchers in genetics, paleobiology and
archaeology present the latest research results on the origins and
natural history of the Scandinavian biota.

Invited speakers:
Inger Alsos - University of Tromsø
Ingela Bergman - Institute for Subarctic Landscape Research
Love Dalén - Swedish Museum of Natural History
Øystein Flagstad - Norwegian Institute for Nature Research
Anders Götherström - Stockholm University
Rolf Ims - University of Tromsø
Sven Isaksson - Stockholm University
Mattias Jakobsson - Uppsala University
Jan Storå - Stockholm University
Eske Willerslev - Natural History Museum of Denmark
