Dear all,

The registration for the PAG meeting is open: International Plant & 
Animal Genome XXV - http://www.intlpag.org/ - January 14-18, 2017  - San 
Diego, CA, USA

This meeting is among the largest for non-human genomics globally 
(thousands of attendants; including a genomics technology fair). Much of 
it is about plant and animal breeding but over the last few years there 
is a growing community of Ecology and Evolution sessions with hundreds 
of attendants across sessions. Last year we successfully hosted a 
session about non-model avian genomics ("Avian Genomics - Going Wild!") 
which was well perceived. Please have a look at the speakers and topics 
of #PAGXXIV: 
https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxiv/meetingapp.cgi/Session/3531. And here 
for reference the overall workshop list of #PAGXXIV: 
https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxiv/meetingapp.cgi/Program/1051.

The conference starts on Saturday, 14th January. On the Friday 13th we 
will do a pre-conference birding tour around San Diego for everyone who 
is interested (not only the speakers!!). If you are at PAG and can't 
give a talk, please be in touch about the birding tour nonetheless.

In our Avian Genomics workshop we seek to present current states of 
*omics in ecology and evolution of birds, as broadly as possible. I 
herewith invite contributions from the community for giving a talk. 
Please send your abstract of 200-300 words to me until 27th August.

Feel free to forward to approach me with questions.

Very best regards,
Robert Kraus
