*Request for Workshop Proposals: Clade Focused Tree-Data Integration
Challenges*

*RFP:* Two page proposals to fund small workshops and/or hackathons on
completing the tree of life and integrating data layers for specific
clades. This is the second set of clade workshops - you can see a summary
from the first workshop on the *Open Tree of Life blog*
<https://blog.opentreeoflife.org/2016/03/09/futurephy-clade-workshops/>. In
this round, we particularly encourage proposals focused on microbes, plants
and fungi.
*Proposal deadline:* Aug. 1, 2016
*Meeting dates:* Oct. 2016
*Location:* Chicago, IL
*Participants per workshop:* 10 maximum funded (virtual attendees possible)
*Contacts:* mwestneat@uchicago.edu (FuturePhy), karen.cranston@gmail.com
(OpenTree), lukejharmon@gmail.com (Arbor)

The challenges to completing the Tree of Life and integrating data layers
(NSF GoLife goals) are huge and vary across clades. Some groups have a
nearly-complete tree but lack publicly available data layers, whereas other
groups lack phylogenetic resolution or the resources to support tree / data
integration. Partnering with Open Tree of Life and Arbor Workflows,
FuturePhy will support a series of clade-based workshops to identify and
solve specific challenges in tree of life synthesis and data layer
integration.

Proposals should focus on challenges in completing the tree of life and
integrating data layers for a clade or clades of interest.
Cross-fertilization among systematists and other fields is desired, with
focus on phylogenetic challenges, data layer development, and/or tree-data
integration and analyses. How can developers of Arbor, OpenTree and other
resources develop tools to help solve these challenges? What tools and
infrastructure are needed for others to solve similar problems?

Proposals (using the *proposal template*
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SJbzT2h1oPGOCGDsETfPjAI8ZKDhrgIS9odZPuxySPw/edit>)
should include (1) the status of the phylogeny for your group, including
availability of trees in Dryad, TreeBASE or Open Tree of Life, (2) target
data layers for the workshops, indicating the locations and accessibility
of the data, (3) key biological questions that you would like to ask, given
availability of trees and data layers, (4) roadmap to tangible products,
with a clear timeline, (5) the challenges to phylogeny and data synthesis
in your clade, with specific targets scoped for progress towards a solution
during the workshop, (6) evidence that public data exist as a starting
point or access to data that can be made public.

General plans & logistics. Each workshop may involve up to 10 funded
attending participants, with the first set of workshops to happen in
parallel at the same time and location. Open Tree of Life, FuturePhy and
Arbor personnel will be there to demo, discuss and plan implementation.
Each group should involve participants familiar with data analysis /
integration / use of web services (e.g., in R, python). Groups can focus
anywhere on the spectrum of completing phylogeny to integrating data
layers. Groups agree to make assembled data or tools publicly available and
to provide a post-workshop report after the event. Phylogenetic data will
be incorporated into Open Tree of Life.

*Evaluation.* Proposals will be evaluated on (1) the feasibility of solving
the specific challenges, including evidence for publicly-available data;
(2) participant diversity (discipline, career stages, gender, ethnicity),
(3) participant expertise, (4) how solving these challenges will benefit
researchers in other clades, (5) potential for increasing public data,
tools, products, and contributing trees to Open Tree of Life and related
initiatives.
