Dear colleagues,

it is our pleasure to announce the 58th Phylogenetic Symposium "Evolution
meets Ecology" which will take place in Leipzig, November 18-20, 2016.
(https://conference.uni-leipzig.de/phylosym2016/)

Both ecology and evolution try to understand the diversity of life,
including the diversity of species, their genetic inventory, the diversity
of functions, interactions and communities; how species and communities
evolve, expand, and demise. We aim at highlighting recent achievements
in evolutionary ecology, their impact on phylogenetics and biodiversity
research, and vice versa.

Confirmed invited speakers are:

Erica Edwards (Providence, Rhode Island): The mega-phylogeny approach
to big evolutionary questions: are we ready for an 'automated natural
history'?

Catherine Graham (Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape
Research WSL): Linking patterns and processes across scales: a case
study with Neotropical hummingbirds

Susanne Fritz (Frankfurt): Macroevolution meets macroecology:
diversification, biogeography, and the evolution of ecological niches
in birds

Alexandre Antonelli (G=F6teborg): Teasing apart the ecological and
environmental drivers of diversification

Susanne Renner (Munich): Do trees and shrubs of North America,
Europe, and Asia have different winter chilling and spring warming
requirements? Insights from experiments, monitoring, and phylogenies

Marten Winter (Leipzig/Halle): Phylogenetic diversity: A biodiversity
facet under threat - insights from invasion ecology and nature
conservation

Christoph Bleidorn (Madrid): Understanding Wolbachia-arthropod symbiosis
using comparative genomic analyses

Christian Lexer (Vienna): Plant evolutionary genomics: speciation
continuum and beyond

Poster presentations by students and postdocs are welcome. The deadline
for abstract submission is September 15, 2016. Please submit your
abstracts directly to Martin Schlegel: schlegel@rz.uni-leipzig.de

Registration can be done online, and is free of charge.

We hope to see you soon here in Leipzig!

Kind regards
