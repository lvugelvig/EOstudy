This advanced course has as main goals to:

1)      (re-)introduce the students to some of the canonical literature
        concerning the process of speciation; and

2)      discuss the paradigm of divergence-with-gene-flow represented by
        the web-of-life metaphor.

The second goal will be accomplished by discussion sections using
Mike's new book (Arnold, M.L. 2016. Divergence With Genetic Exchange.
Oxford University Press), as a distillation of many studies of natural
hybridization, lateral exchange and viral recombination.
