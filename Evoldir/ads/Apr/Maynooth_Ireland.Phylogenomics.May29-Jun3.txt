PHYLOGENOMICS SUMMER SCHOOL 2016 (MAY 29TH - JUNE 3RD)

http://mcinerneylab.com/evolution/phylogenomics-summer-school-2016-may-29th-june3rd/

(Est. 1999)

What?: Week-long, intensive phylogenetics course covering all aspects of
bioinformatics and phylogenetics/phylogenomics.  Where?: Department of
Biology, National University of Ireland Maynooth.  This is approximately
40 minutes from Dublin Airport (Serviced by Aer Lingus, British Airways,
Ryanair, American Airlines, Lufthansa, Air France, etc.) ,  25km from
the centre of Dublin, Ireland.  When?: Sunday May 29th - Friday June 3rd
(inclusive), 2016.

Who is it for?: This course starts with the basics of bioinformatics
- unix computer usage, genome assembly, gene prediction and genome
annotation.

The course then leads on to phylogenetic reconstruction and deals with
all the major methods and all kinds of data from genes to genomes.
Therefore, it is particularly suited to researchers that have a keen
interest in phylogenetic reconstruction, but have little or no practical
experience or theoretical background (ideally suited to new Masters/PhD
students/post-docs, but also investigators moving into this area of
research).

We welcome organismal phylogeneticists or genome scientists who are trying
to make sense of the evolutionary history of any kind of gene or genome.

Who has taken this course in the past?: Researchers from every continent
and every stage of their career, from early-stage Masters students,
to Professors with 40 years experience in research.

Course structure: Every day will begin with formal lectures covering all
parts of phylogenetic reconstruction.  The afternoons will be taken up
with practicals.  In addition, the course will have specific lectures that
demonstrate "use cases" for phylogenetics, with examples from prokaryotes,
animals, plants, protozoans and fungi.

Student involvement:  All students are expected to give a five minute
presentation of their research agenda.  This will happen towards the
beginning of the week, in order to encourage discussions during the
course.

Course fee: 750. This includes a welcome reception on Sunday May 29th,
all coffee breaks and all lunches during the week and the course dinner
on Thursday evening. It does not include accommodation.

Accommodation: If you are accepted on the course, we will make several
recommendations for inexpensive (27 - 70 per night) or more
luxurious accommodation (100-250 per night).  You must organise
and pay for your own accommodation.

Application process:

You first place an order for a place on the course (email
phyloinformatic@gmail.com).  You must include your CV and a half-page
letter of interest, stating your position and why you want to do the
course.  You will get a yes/no answer within two working days and if the
answer is yes, you will get a link to a BACS payment system.  You will
then have five working days to make the payment. Your place on the course
will be held for that time.  Please email us at phyloinformatic@gmail.com
if you need more information.

Note 1: All students will be presented with a certificate of completion
for this course and it can be used as part of post-graduate studies.

Note 2: We have found it better if students bring their own laptops.
Please let us know if this is a problem for you and we will supply
a laptop.
