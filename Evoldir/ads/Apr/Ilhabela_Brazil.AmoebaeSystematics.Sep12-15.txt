Dear colleague,

It is with great pleasure that we invite you to the 8th International
Symposium on Testate Amoebae, during the days of September 12-15th, in
Ilhabela, S=E3o Paulo, Brazil.

The Symposium is promoted every two years by the International Society for
Testate Amoebae Research (ISTAR).  It typically gathers participants from
more than 20 countries, presenting projects on all aspects of research in
Testate Amoebae - taxonomy, systematics, ecology, paleontology among
others.  This year, it is the first time in history that ISTA will be held
in the Americas, this was made possible by the logistical and structural
help of the Brazilian Society of Protozoology (SBPz).

A very special feature of this symposium is the first-ever, ISOP
(International Society of Protistologists) sponsored Young Testate Amoebae
Investigator Award (ISOP/YoTAR).  Six young scientists will be awarded with
this prize and have the opportunity to present in a special session during
the conference.  A financial reimbursement will be provided to help these
young scientists to attend the conference. More details are available at
the symposium website.

Keynote presentations will be made by:

Dr. Laura Katz  Smith College, MA, USA
Dr. Mariusz Lametowiczs  Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland
Dr. Anush Kosakyan  University of S=E3o Paulo, SP, Brazil
Dr. Susannah Porter  Department of Earth Science, University of California
at Santa Barbara

Registration is open until May 20th. More details are available at the
