Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops present:
Next Generation Methods for Mapping Genomics Features and Clinical Traits

Course Dates: July 18 - 19

Instructors: Philip Awadalla (Ontario Institute for Cancer Research)
and Stephen Montgomery (Standford University)

Location: Downtown Toronto, ON

Registration:

This 2 day workshop focuses on the genetics and analysis of genomes
and quantitative traits in human populations, with emphasis on
population genetic inference, genetic mapping, estimation and prediction
analysis of discrete (diseases) and quantitative traits using genomic
resources. Principles and pitfalls of prediction analyses using genetic
markers and eQTL mapping will also be discussed.

Participants will gain practical experience and skills to be able to:

* Estimate population genetic parameters using partial or whole-genome data
* Infer relatedness from genomic data
* Evaluate GWAS data for quantitative traits
* Use GWAS data to estimate and partition genetic variance
* Infer Gene x Environment interactions using multi-omic approaches (eg. eQTL mapping)

Course Outline

Day 1

Module 1 - Concepts in Population Genomics (2016)

Basic concepts in population genomics (drift, structure, inbreeding)
Parametric and Non-parametric Inference in population genetics for
inferences of mutation

Lab Practical: The following lab exercises will be done in R

Hapmap/genotyping data vs. whole genome/sequencing data
Simulations ¡V coalescent, forward simulations
MCMC ¡V extensions of the coalescent, capturing and estimating mutation
and recombination events/rates

Module 2 - Extensions in Population Genomics (2016)

The coalescent
Extensions of the coalescent including inferences of recombination and
population structure

Module 3 - QTLs (2016)

Basic concepts in QTL mapping in inbred populations and outbred populations
Linkage analysis for quantitative traits

Lab Practical:

Principals of linkage analyses (PLINK, Merlin)
Analytical treatment of discrete (binary) outcome data versus continuous data

Day 2

Module 4 - More QTLs (2016)

Whole genome linkage analysis
GWAS for quantitative traits
Imputation

Lab Practical:

GCTA, Replication and Multiple testing correction
Covariates and relatedness

Module 5 - Gene x Environment (2016)

Basic concepts in gene expression analysis: RNAseq, eQTLs inferences
Integrating phenotypic and environmental data

Module 6 - Functional Annotation of Mutations & Haplotypes (2016)

Impact of selection and disease on mutations
Classical approaches to mapping mutations and genes under selection or
potentially damaging/associated with disease
Constraint and selection,- polyphen, SIFT, GERP, etc.

Lab Practical:

Modeling dominance and functional impact
Inferences using whole genome data of constraint
Simulations and analyses of mutation trajectories and impact on linked loci

Registration and Travel awards available.
