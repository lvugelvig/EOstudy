We are pleased to announce a symposium on Genomics of Adaptation to Human
Contexts will be held at Colorado State University on July 30, 2016. This
symposium will highlight exemplar research that uses large genomic datasets
to investigate ecology and evolution in the Anthropocene, featuring keynote
talks by Regina Baucom (UMichigan) and Robert Wayne (UCLA). The symposium
will be paired with a Software Carpentry workshop (July 28-29, 2016) to
train early career researchers in the essential programmatic tools needed
to analyze such datasets. The symposium and accompanying workshop are
jointly funded by the American Genetic Association and the Genetics Society
of America. Please see our website (https://adapt2humans.wordpress.com/)
for information on how to register and more!

Registration is required but free for both the workshop and symposium.
Space in the workshop is limited, and we will be offering limited travel
funds for workshop attendees traveling from outside of the local area.
Registration closes on May 15.

See you in July!
