PhD course: High throughput sequencing of non-model organisms DR425F
- 2016

The Faculty of Biosciences and Aquaculture at Nord University
31 May 2016 - 10 June 2016

The Faculty of Biosciences and Aquaculture at Nord University takes
great pleasure in inviting you to the annual PhD course "High throughput
sequencing of non-model organisms" (DR425F) 31 May - 10 June 2016. 
High throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are being applied to a wide
range of important topics in biology. However, the analyses of non-model
organisms, for which little previous sequence information is available,
pose specific problems. This course will address the specific strengths
and weaknesses of alternative HTS technologies, the computational
resources needed for HTS, and how to analyze non-model species using
HTS. The course consists of practical training in preparing and running
fragment libraries, HTS bioinformatics training, and lecturing/seminars
of HTS approaches specifically targeting non-model organisms.

A detailed course description is available here
[http://www.nord.no/en/studies/programmes-courses/find-programmes-courses/2016h/1/Pages/DR425Fv1.aspx].

We will accept a maximum of 10 students. 
The closing date for applications is April 29.
