Dear colleagues,

This is a reminder for the workshop on *"Optimal Contribution Selection"*

arraged by The Nordic Genetic Resource Center (NordGen) in Hafjell (Øyer
municipality north of Lillehammer), Norway 6th-10th of June 2016.

The main goals of the workshop are:

   - to introduce the theory and implementation of Optimal Contribution
   Selection in sustainable management of breeding and conservation programs

   - to promote the independent use of EVA (EVolutionary Algorithms)
   software with hands-on exercises

To maximize the learning experience of all participants, the workshop is
divided into two parts. Participants may choose to register for *both* *or
only one* of the consecutive parts: "*Part I - Introductory"* and "*Part II
- Advanced"*. The maximum number of participants in Part I and Part II are
20 and 25, respectively. There are still few places left on both parts.
