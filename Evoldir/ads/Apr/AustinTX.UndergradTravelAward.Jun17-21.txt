Reminder: Travel Award - Undergraduate Diversity at Evolution 2016

Applications for the undergraduate travel award to bring talented and
diverse undergraduates to the Evolution meetings this June 17-21 in Austin,
TX (www.evolutionmeetings.org) are due in less than two weeks on April
18th. Application form and more information at http://beacon-center.org/ude/

Details: For the 13th year a cohort of undergraduates from throughout the
U.S. and Puerto Rico will be funded to (1) present a poster at the
meetings, (2) receive mentoring from graduate students, postdocs and
faculty, and (3) participate in a career-oriented 'Undergraduate Futures in
Evolutionary Biology' panel and discussion.  The program is sponsored by
SSE/BEACON and covers the costs of travel, registration, food and
accommodation at the meetings. The application deadline is Monday, April
18th, and decisions will be announced by Tuesday, April 26th.

Applications are welcomed from all undergraduates, and the admissions goal
is to create a diverse pool of students.  An overview of the program and
the online application can be found at: http://beacon-center.org/ude/.
Applications consist of a short statement of interest, a letter of
recommendation, and the title and abstract of the poster to be presented.

Two events organized by the program on June 20th, the Undergraduate Futures
Lecture and Panel Discussion (11:30AM) and Undergraduate Ice Cream Social
(8PM), are open to ANY attending undergraduates or post-baccalaureates,
regardless of award status/eligibility, as well as their advisors/mentors.

We are also looking for mentors for the program. Please email Dr. Kliman or
indicate your interest in being a mentor on the Evolution 2016 conference
