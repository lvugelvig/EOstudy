 INTRODUCTION TO NICHE MODELLING
 SECOND EDITION
 18-22 July 2016
 Observatorio Astronomico Prof. Manuel de Barros
 Faculty of Sciences  o  University of Porto
 Alameda do Monte da Virgem, Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal
 
 Do you want to know what is an Niche Model and how to calculate
 it? Do you want to use ecological niche models to support a species'
 description? Or to evaluate niche conservatism inside a taxonomical group?
 This course will teach you the base theory of ecological niche modelling
 and its main methodologies. By the end of this 5-day practical course, you
 will have the capacity to perform ecological niche models and understand
 their results. You will be able to choose and apply the correct
 methodology depending in the aim of your study and type of datasets.
 
 This course is orientated to PhD and MSc students, as well as other
 students and researchers working on biogeography, evolutionary biology,
 systematists, or related disciplines. Participants will receive a diploma
 of course attendance, copies of presentations and materials used, one
 selection of the most relevant articles on Niche Modelling, and
 a copy of programs and other tools used in the course.
 
 The course will be mainly practical, with some theoretical lectures. All
 modelling processes and calculations will be performed with R, the free
 software environment for statistical computing and graphics
 (http://www.r-project.org/). Students will learn to use modelling
 algorithms like Maxent, Bioclim, Domain, and logistic regressions, and R
 packages for computing ENMs like Dismo and Biomod2. Also, students will
 learn to compare different ecological niche models with Ecospat package.
 
 **
 Recommended Background
 Basic knowledge in Geographical Information Systems and R statistical
 package is necessary.
 
 **
 Course Format
 The first course day will be mainly theoretical. The following days will
 be mainly practical with some short theoretical presentations.  The course
 will be lectured in English.
