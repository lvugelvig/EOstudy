Dear Friends and Colleagues,

*There is one week left to Register and Submit an Abstract for the Ecology
and Evolution of Infectious Disease meeting to be held at Cornell
University June 3-5.*

Registration and Abstract Submission will close on May 2.

For those of you who may be interested in presenting a poster, we will be
working with a professional poster printing service that accept your
electronic files and credit card payments and deliver the posters to me the
day before the conference. I will the posters printed through this service
available on the first day of the conference - no carrying your poster on
the plane! Details on this service will be sent with the formal poster
assignments shortly after the abstract submission deadline.

Registration fees are $100 for Students and $175 for Faculty/Staff.
On-campus lodging is also modestly priced.
