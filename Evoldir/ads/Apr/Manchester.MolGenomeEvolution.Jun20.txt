Registration and abstract submission are now open for Manchester's 
Molecular and Genome Evolution Symposium (#MaGE2016) on Monday 20th June!

The remit of the symposium is broad, including all aspects of molecular 
and genome evolution, ranging from genomic analyses or computational 
algorithm development, to molecular ecology, population genetics, and 
experimental evolution (see https://manchestermage.wordpress.com/)

MaGE 2016 will be a day-long event in Manchester's Michael Smith 
Building including two plenary lectures, a series of contributed talks, 
and a poster session. Plenary lectures will be given by Mary O'Connell 
(who has recently set up a Computational & Molecular Evolutionary 
Biology Group at the University of Leeds: http://mol-evol.org) and Jonas 
Warringer (known for his work on genotype-phenotype relationships at the 
University of Gothenberg).

MaGE is free to attend, but places are limited so please register at 
https://goo.gl/aAKlq9 and submit a title if you would like to present a 
talk or poster. We are particularly keen to give PhD students and 
post-docs a chance to present their work. All contributed talks and 
posters will also be considered for a prize, presented at the drinks 
reception following the symposium.

Hope to see you in June!
