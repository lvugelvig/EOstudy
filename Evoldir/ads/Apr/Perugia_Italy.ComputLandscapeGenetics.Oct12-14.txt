*Open computational landscape genetics* session

at the

*Open Source Geospatial Research & Education Symposium (OGRS) 2016*
http://2016.ogrs-community.org

*October 12-14*, 2016
Perugia, Italy

- Organizer: OGRS 2016 steering committee 
(http://2016.ogrs-community.org) led by Dr Ivan Marchesini, National 
Research Council, IRPI, Italy
- Conveners of the session on Open computational landcape genetics: 
Stéphane Joost, Solange Duruz

Goals of the session:
- Gather together people involved in the development of open software 
applications used in the field of population and landscape genetics or 
in other subfields of evolutionary biology with a geographic dimension.
- Unique opportunity for the scientific community active at the 
intersection of computer science,  evolutionary biology and geographic 
information science to present recent or previous works, to share 
knowledge and to discuss the main advantages and drawbacks of developing 
open source software solutions.
- Take stock of the situation as regards different challenges for open 
computational landscape genetics (e.g. whole genome sequence data, 
training of biogeoinformaticians, effective use of computational 
landscape genetic solutions in conservation programmes)

Invited speakers:
*Dr Olivier François*, Laboratory TIMC-IMAG, CNRS, UniversityJoseph 
Fourier, Grenoble France
*Dr Thibaut Jombart*, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, 
Imperial College, London
*Dr Ezechiel Nicolazzi*, Parco Tecnologico Padano · Statistical Genomics 
and Bioinformatics group

The call for short papers (1000-1500 words) is now open until *June 15, 
2016*.
All publications will be released in collaboration with the PeerJ Open 
Access publisher.
Symposium proceedings will be published within a dedicated PeerJ 
Collection and the best papers will be seleted for submission to the 
PeerJ Computer Science journal.
