EARLYBIRD REGISTRATION CLOSES MAY 1ST

TheAmerican Genetic Association President's Symposium, 'Local
adaptation: from phenotype to genotype to fitness', will be held July
14-17, 2016, at beautiful Asilomar, CA (http://www.visitasilomar.com/).

Inthe past, many studies dealt only with phenotypes/traits, but today the
connection to genotype is becoming feasible for more and more organisms.
Our speakers are a blend of established and new investigators, working
on a variety of organisms, and who are taking diverse approaches to
the question.

TheAGA will provide several travel awards to cover registration
for graduate students who would like to attend and present posters.
Six abstracts will be selected for oral presentations, and the students
will receive $500 awards.  DEADLINE TO SUBMIT ABSTRACTS IS APRIL 25TH.
