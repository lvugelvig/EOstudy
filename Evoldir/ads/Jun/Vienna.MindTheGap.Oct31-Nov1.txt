MIND THE GAP 5
Conference
Vienna, Austria
October 31 and November 1, 2016

Bridging the gap between theoretical and empirical population genetics

The students of the Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics are
proud to announce the  fifth MIND THE GAP conference to be held on
October 31 and November 1, 2016 at the campus of Vetmeduni Vienna,
Austria.

MIND THE GAP aims at bringing together theoretical and empirical
population geneticists. This conference is the fifth meeting in a
series of conferences held in Freiburg (2009), Plön (2010),  Cologne
(2011), and Vienna (2013).

As in these past meetings, there are different main topics for this
conference. This year's themes are:

- Evolutionary inference using time series data
- Adaptive QTLs and their genomic signatures
- Phenotypic plasticity
- Introgression: signatures of selected and neutral alleles

Invited speakers:
Nick Barton (IST Austria, A)
Alan Bergland (Univ. of Virginia, USA)
Luis-Miguel Chevin (CEFE/CNRS, FR)
Oscar Gaggiotti (Univ. of St. Andrews, UK)
Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas (University of Bern, CH)
Fernando Racimo (Univ. of California, Berkeley, USA)
Wolfgang Stephan (LMU Munich, GER)
Lev Yampolsky (East Tennessee State Univ., USA)

A few remaining speaker slots are still available for which we invite
you to apply by July 17th.

Attendance to the conference will be free of charge but space is
limited. Details about registration can be found on our website:
