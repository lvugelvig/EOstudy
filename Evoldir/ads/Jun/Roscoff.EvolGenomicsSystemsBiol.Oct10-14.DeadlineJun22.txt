Dear all,

We have the pleasure to announce a CNRS-Jacques Monod Conference 
entitled "Evolutionary genomics and systems biology: bringing together 
theoretical and experimental approaches" that will take place in Roscoff 
(France) from 10 to 14 October 2016.

Deadline for abstract submission (mandatory for participation to a 
Jacques Monod Conference): 22 June 2016 (see instructions on CNRS 
website http://www.cnrs.fr/insb/cjm/2016/Vekemans_e.html)
The organizers: Xavier Vekemans (UMR Evo-Eco-Paléo, Lille; 
xavier.vekemans@univ-lille1.fr) and Christian Landry (Institut Biologie 
Intégrative et des Systèmes, Laval University, Québec; 
christian.landry@bio.ulaval.ca)

Presentation of the conference:
Genomic tools are becoming essential in biological investigations that 
relate to agriculture, medicine, biotechnology and biodiversity science. 
Moreover, evolutionary concepts and an evolutionary genomics perspective 
are becoming central to interpret any new finding in these fields and 
develop forward approaches for problem solving. The potential of 
evolutionary genomics is unparalleled as it provides key insights into 
our understanding of many fundamental and applied questions such as the 
evolutionary history of life on earth and the molecular bases of 
adaptation of species in response to environmental changes in natural 
populations and crop improvement. However, the maturation of 
evolutionary thinking in these fields involving genomic approaches is an 
ongoing process and needs to be supported by initiatives that will 
update key analytical, conceptual and experimental innovations in 
evolutionary genomics.

The objective of the proposed conference is to make such synthesis 
possible by bringing leaders in the field together to discuss their 
ongoing research and vision of where the field is moving over the coming 
years. Accordingly, we aim at fostering the link between functional and 
evolutionary perspectives towards an integrative approach of 
evolutionary genomics, and propose a conference with: two sessions on 
evolutionary systems biology and experimental evolution; one session on 
genome evolution; two sessions on theoretical and empirical population 
genomics. Because evolutionary genomics largely focuses on processes 
(how mutations arise and fix in populations) and systems biology on 
functions (how mutations are translated into phenotypes), we are 
convinced that this combination will allow to progress towards a better 
understanding of evolutionary processes and its applications.
Besides this focus on an integrative approach, a second aim of the 
conference is to bring together evolutionary genomic researchers working 
on a large panel of organisms, from bacteria to humans, including e.g. 
plants and fungi, in order to foster the cross-exchange of evolutionary 
concepts, analytical methods and experimental approaches.
