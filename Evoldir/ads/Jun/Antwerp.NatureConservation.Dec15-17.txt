Dear All,

We are very happy to announce the upcoming Zoology 2016 congress and
its CRC-satellite symposium, taking place from 15 to 17 December 2016 at
Antwerp University and the Antwerp ZOO. This year's edition will be the
23th zoology congress annually organised on behalf of the Royal Belgian
and Dutch Zoological Societies. At the Zoology Congress, zoologists
studying life in all its aspects (from molecules to ecosystems) will meet
and discuss. Young scientists are particularly invited to participate, but
all zoologists, at any stage of their careers, are very welcome to submit.

The theme for the keynote presentations is Nature conservation in
a changing world. Our planet is in the midst of a wave of man-made
extinction. Reversing this dreadful trend will require input from 
various fields in biology and beyond. In an attempt to stimulate a
multidisciplinary approach to conservation biology, Zoology 2016 has
invited four keynote speakers who are studying zoological biodiversity
issues from different angles. However, the organizers await submissions
from all fields in animal sciences.

Linked to the keynote theme, the Antwerp ZOO Centre for Research and
Conservation (CRC) will present the results of its research projects in
zoo-science and conservation to a general public during the satellite
symposium.

Please, visit the website at www.zoology2016.be for more detailed
information, registration and abstract submission. 

We look forward to meeting you at Zoology 2016.

 
Prof. Gudrun De Boeck, (Chair Scientific Committee)

Prof. Peter Aerts, (Chair Organising Committee)
