7 weeks until the American Genetic Association Presidents Symposium,
Local adaptation: from phenotype to genotype to fitness, at beautiful
Asilomar, CA (http://www.visitasilomar.com/).

In the past, many studies dealt only with phenotypes/traits, but today the
connection to genotype is becoming feasible for more and more organisms.
Our speakers are a blend of established and new investigators, working
