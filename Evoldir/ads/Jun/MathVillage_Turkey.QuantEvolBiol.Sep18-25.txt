*Workshop/ Summer school
"Quantitative Evolutionary Biology -- building bridges between evolutionary
theory and empirical approaches to evolution in the genomic era"

*Time and Place
September 18-25, 2016, Mathematics Village, Sirince, near Izmir,Turkey.

*Keynote lecturers
Nicola Barson (Norwegian University of Life Sciences, As)
Laurent Duret (University of Lyon)
Pavlos Pavlidis (Institute of Computer Science - FORTH, Heraklion)
Judith Mank (University College London)

*Description
The workshop is mainly targeted towards advanced graduate students and
early post-docs studying evolutionary biology. Our main aim is to bring
together researchers and students studying aspects of natural evolution
with theoretical, empirical and genomic approaches. Students will get an
overview of the state of the art in several fields of evolutionary biology
through lectures by established researchers and learn to develop their own
scientific ideas by pursuing collaborative short projects. There will also
be various short lectures and seminars during the workshop.
