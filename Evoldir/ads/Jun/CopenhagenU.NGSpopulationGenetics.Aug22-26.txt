PhD course in analyses of genotyping and next ­generation sequencing data 
in medical and population genetics

When:
August 22 - August 26  2016

Where:
Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen Denamrk

Instructors:
Brenna Henn, Matteo Fumagalli, Fernando Racimo,  Anders Albrechtsen and 
Ida Moltke

The course is a comprehensive introduction to a number of topics
and common research tools used in analyses of genetic data. Topics
include: genetic drift, natural selection, population structure, Fst,
linkage disequilibrium, association mapping, GWAS, genotyping data,
next ­generation sequencing (NGS) data, 1000 genomes project data. The
main focus will be on humans, but the analysis methods are applicable to
many other species as well. Lectures will be combined with hands ­on
computer exercises mostly using R and command ­line ­based programs.
The course is free for all PhD students at Danish universities (KU, AU,
AUC, SDU and DTU). For all other PhD students there is a course fee of
