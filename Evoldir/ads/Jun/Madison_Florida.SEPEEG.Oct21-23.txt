The 43rd annual Southeastern Population Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics
meeting (SEPEEG, pronounced "seepage") will be held on the weekend of
October 21-23 at Camp Cherry Lake in Madison, Florida.  SEPEEG provides a
friendly, informal setting for students, postdocs, and faculty to meet,
talk science and relax around the campfire.  The meeting will be hosted
by the University of Florida Department of Biology.  Registration will
open on or about September 1, 2016 and will cost $125/person.  Some funds
will be available for student travel, generously provided by the American
Society of Naturalists.  A SEPEEG web site will appear in the near
future and will be announced on EvolDir.  Until then, please contact
the organizers, Stuart McDaniel (stuartmcdaniel@ufl.edu) or Charlie Baer
(cbaer@ufl.edu) for further information.
