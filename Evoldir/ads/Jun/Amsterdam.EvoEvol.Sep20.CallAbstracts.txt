CALL FOR  EXTENDED ABSTRACTS

EvoEvo workshop

Satellite workshop of the 2016 Conference on Complex Systems (CCS16)
http://www.ccs2016.org/

Tuesday 20 Sep 2016, Beurs Van Berlage, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

AIMS AND SCOPE
Variation and Selection are the two core processes of Darwinian
Evolution. Yet, both are directly regulated by many processes that are
themselves products of evolution (e.g. DNA repair, mutator genes,
transposable elements, horizontal transfer, stochasticity of gene
expression, sex, network modularity, niche construction; ). This
results in the ability of evolution to self-modify its operators, hence
its dynamics. We call this process "Evolution of Evolution" or EvoEvo.

Different EvoEvo strategies have been proposed in the literature,
including regulation of variability, robustness/evolvability strategies
and bet-hedging, but finding traces of these strategies in extant
organisms is difficult. Moreover all these strategies are likely to
interact one with the others, blurring their respective outcomes.

However, new tools are now available that help understanding EvoEvo. On
the one hand, large scale bioinformatic data analysis can be used to
recognize signatures of evolution of evolution. On the other hand,
large scale computational modelling of multi-level evolution is now
becoming feasible, and promises to shed light on the conditions under
which evolutionary mechanisms evolve as well as their consequences.

The aim of the EvoEvo workshop is to seek for a unified theory of
Evolution of Evolution and bring together researchers from various
fields in computational biology to tackle this challenge. The workshop
will take place as a satellite workshop of CCS 2016, Amsterdam, NL. The
EvoEvo workshop is an initiative of the EvoEvo consortium funded by the
FP7 EU-FET grant EvoEvo (ICT-610427).

AREAS OF INTEREST
 We are seeking submissions that explore all aspects of "Evolution of
 Evolution", including theoretical and experimental works (including
 in vivo, in vitro and in silico experiment). Topics include but are
 not limited to:
-    Evolution of robustness and evolvability, evolution of pleiotropy
-    Evolution of mutation rates, regulation of variability, mutators,
     transposable elements, chromosomal rearrangements
-    Open-ended evolution
-    Evolution of the genotype-to-phenotype mapping
-    Niche construction, evolution of trophic networks, evolution of
     cooperation
-    Evolution of genes and metabolic networks, evolution of modularity
-    Evolution of stochastic gene expression and bet-hedging
-    Modeling and simulation of EvoEvo, EvoEvo and fitness
     landscapes/seascapes
-    Experimental characterization of EvoEvo
-    Application of EvoEvo to evolutionary computation
-    Philosophical, theoretical and practical aspects of EvoEvo

SUBMISSIONS
EvoEvo will accept extended abstracts of maximum 2000 words in LNCS
format. All submissions will be peer reviewed by at least two members
of the workshop committee. Accepted papers will be selected for long
or short oral presentation during the workshop.

Abstracts should be submitted via EasyChair
