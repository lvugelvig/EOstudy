Dear Colleagues,

The field of population genetics has a remarkable tradition of being a
tight-knit and nurturing community. In order to better foster that sense of
community for popgen groups in the Midwest, *we are organizing the third
edition of the Midwest PopGen conference*.

The location this year will be the University of Chicago.  The date this
year will be: August 26th-27th.  The meeting will begin Friday at noon and
continue to Saturday evening with a BBQ on Friday evening.

Approximately fifteen 25-minute talks will be selected from submitted
abstracts, and there will be a poster session. The meeting will again be
trainee-oriented, so students and postdocs are especially encouraged to
present their work.  There will be a small prize for best poster and best
talk by a student and postdoctoral fellow.

If you do plan to attend, please RSVP by adding your name and information
to the registration list (http://bit.ly/1Yb3Pkl) and if you would like to
given an oral presentation submit your abstracts by July 25th to Candice
Lewis <cllewis at uchicago dot edu>.  Submitters will be notified if their
abstract is chosen for a talk by August 1st.  A tentative schedule and
accommodation advice are also provided as tabs on the registration Google
Sheet (http://bit.ly/1Yb3Pkl).

We hope you can make it and that we can continue this meeting for the
population geneticists in our region!

All the best,

John Novembre, UChicago
