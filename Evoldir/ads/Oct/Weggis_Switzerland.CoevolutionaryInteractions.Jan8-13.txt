-AIMS and OBJECTIVES

The goal of our 5-days workshop is to bring together an outstanding
group of experts that develop conceptual, theoretical and experimental
approaches to study the ecological genomics of coevolutionary
interactions. These instructors will introduce workshop participants to
modern concepts, models and methods that are widely being used or are
currently being developed. The first four days of the workshop will
consist of lectures and practical demonstrations given by the
instructors, followed by hands-on exercises performed by the
participants under guided supervision. The lectures will focus on
current topics and latest developments relevant for investigating
ecogenomics of coevolutionary interactions (see program: inferring
co-demographic histories and testing for co-adaptation). Participants
will focus on datasets provided by the instructors in the light of new
developments. On the fifth day, thematic talk sessions with
presentations from invited speakers and selected participants will
illustrate current research on the ecological genomics of coevolution.
In order to enhance discussions during the five-day workshop, we will
also ask participants to present a poster of their own work on the
first day to introduce themselves and their research topic.
