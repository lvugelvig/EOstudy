10th International Macrostomum Meeting: Evolution and Development in
the free-living flatworm genus Macrostomum

We are happy to announce that we will hold the "10th International
Macrostomum Meeting" (10th IMM) here in Basel. The meeting will last
from the evening of Friday, 25.11.2016 at 18:00 to the evening of Sunday,
27.11.2016 at around 16:00.

With the "First International Macrostomum Meeting", which took place in
2007, also in Basel, we have started a tradition of bringing together
annually the community of researchers that are either using flatworms of
the genus Macrostomum in their research or who are otherwise interested
in research on these interesting model organisms.

The topics of contributed talks and posters will likely span aging,
bioadhesion, development, evolution, proteomics, genomics, karyology,
regeneration, physiology, taxonomy, phylogenetics and sexual selection. It
is a great opportunity to get an update on what is happening in the
Macrostomum Community, and to establish personal contacts if you want
to start working on these lovely worms.

As before, we want to keep things very simple and we expect everyone to
be prepared to cover their own costs. In addition, we will, during the
meeting, collect a small fee to cover sandwich lunches, refreshments and
a joint dinner on Saturday evening (60 Euros in total). For students we
can try to find floor space accommodation in the apartments of people
in our group (just bring along a mat and a sleeping bag). Please let
us know if you would like to be accommodated in this way (see the form
below). We'll do what we can.

The other people should make a hotel reservation soon, because there
are many fairs in Basel, and hotels can fill up quickly. A good option
is the Hotel Rochat (http://www.hotelrochat.ch), where we routinely
host guests that visit our department, and which is just five minutes
by foot from the Institute. Please contact them directly to make your
arrangements/payments.

For people coming by plane, please note that Easyjet
(http://www.easyjet.com), Swiss (http://www.swiss.com), and
AirBerlin (http://www.airberlin.com/) are flying to Basel
(http://www.euroairport.com/en/) from many European destinations.

If you would like to attend the meeting (and present a poster or talk)
please fill out and return the form below to lukas.scharer@unibas.ch
until 30. October at the latest.

Hopefully see you soon in Basel,
