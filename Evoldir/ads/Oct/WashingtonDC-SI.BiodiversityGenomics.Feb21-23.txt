Registration is now open for BioGenomics2017: the Global Biodiversity
Genomics Conference, to be held at the Smithsonian's National Museum
of Natural History, February 21-23, 2017.

The opening day of the conference will be highlighted by a feature talk
by E.O. Wilson and 12 other plenary talks, and the day will conclude
with a reception in the Museum's famed Rotunda.

Conference details and registration are now open at: BioGenomics2017.org

The Global Biodiversity Genomics Conference will bring together thought
leaders, researchers, and academics who are leading the charge in applying
genomic technologies to understand all of life. The conference will be
one of the first to address the transition from a scientific emphasis on
human genomics to one on global biodiversity genomics, as investigations
in this arena are increasing rapidly.  The meeting will also focus on
interactions and synergies among biodiversity researchers, computational
scientists, sequencing technologists, and software developers.

The conference will have sessions that cover a broad array of relevant
topics, including specific evolutionary and ecological questions and
the genomics of broad taxonomic groups (e.g. plants, vertebrates,
invertebrates, and microbes) as well as critical technological and
analytical tools.

Attendance will be capped at 450 participants.
