European Conference of Tropical Ecology (GTOE)
"(re)connecting tropical biodiversity in space and time" - Brussels 6-10 
February 2017
CALL FOR ORAL AND POSTER PRESENTATIONS

We are pleased to announce that the "European Conference of Tropical 
Ecology" - the annual scientific meeting of the Society for Tropical 
Ecology (GTOE) - will be organized in 2017 for the first time in 
Brussels, Belgium. The overarching topic will be "(re)connecting 
tropical biodiversity in space and time". It highlights both the 
importance of integrating fundamental sciences inferring past processes 
(e.g. paleoecology, evolution, social history .) to understand current 
patterns of biodiversity, and the urgent need to reconnect patches of 
fragmented landscapes if we wish to conserve tropical biodiversity and 
ecological services of tropical ecosystems for future generations.

When: 6-10 February 2017
Where: Brussels, Belgium
Deadline for abstracts and early registration: Please submit your 
proposal, until the 31 of October 2016, on the conference webpage: 
http://www.soctropecol-2017.eu/

This conference aims to connect researchers at all levels of their 
career and from all disciplines relevant to tropical ecology, and to 
promote scientific exchanges and cooperation in a friendly atmosphere. 
Students and young scientists are very welcome and to encourage them, we 
make our best to maintain costs accessible to all, including nice social 
events. Thirty sessions are open, and it is time to register to 
participate to this stimulating conference!
