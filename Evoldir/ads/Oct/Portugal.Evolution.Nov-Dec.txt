Course EvoS-2

organized by Filipa Vala| November 21-December 16 2016 @ Lisbon,
Portugal

Objectives: Evolutionary theory provides a framework for understanding
all living systems. Nevertheless, throughout the 20^th century, with
a few exceptions, evolutionary biologists have "avoided" using
evolution to address problems related to our own species. EvoS is a
program created by David Sloan Wilson at the University of Binghamton,
and later adopted at other faculties that have joined into the EvoS
international consortium. EvoS aims at turning evolutionary theory into
a common language to areas that pertain to the natural world, including
human affairs. This advanced course is part of the EvoS programme at
the University of Lisbon.

Course Island Biogeography
organized by Ana Margarida Santos | December 19-22, 2016 @ Lisbon, Portugal

Objectives: This four days intensive course introduces the field of
island biogeography, a discipline that has long influenced other research
areas such as macroecology, community ecology, evolution and conservation
biology. This course covers the main aspects of island biogeography, and
on completion of the course the students shall have acquired knowledge
and understanding on: 1) Ecological/evolutionary theories developed from
studies on islands, and its applications in other research areas; 2)
Processes that occur during and after island colonization, that shape
island communities; 3) Island evolutionary processes; 4) Applications
of island biogeography to conservation biology

Course Soil Ecology and Ecosystem Services
organized by Teresa Dias and Cristina Cruz | January 9-13 2017 @ Lisbon,
Portugal

Objectives: This five days intensive course aims at introducing
attendants to an updated state of the art of diversity of the soil biota
and the functional roles played by soil organisms in key ecological
processes. SoilEco will have the participation of some of the most
relevant specialists in the field and will enable an 'hands on'
approach to the study of soil biology and ecology. The course will
include both theoretical and practical (laboratory and desk) classes
oriented in a problem solving perspective.

Course Hands on Functional Diversity: from Ecological Indicators to
Ecosystem Services organized by Laura Concostrina-Zubiri, Paula Matos,
Alice Nunes et al. | January 16-20 2017 @ Lisbon, Portugal

Objectives: Under the general framework of Global Change Ecology, the
goal of this five days intensive course is to provide the participants
