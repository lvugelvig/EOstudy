Dear colleagues,

Transmitting Science is offering a new course: "Mapping Trait Evolution", June
5th-9th, 2017.

Instructor: Dr. Jeroen Smaers (Stony Brook University, USA).

* What is the basic structure of phylogenetic data?
* How to visualize and manipulate phylogenetic data?
* Afternoon: Models of evolution.
* What are models of evolution?
* What are the assumptions of the different models of evolution?
