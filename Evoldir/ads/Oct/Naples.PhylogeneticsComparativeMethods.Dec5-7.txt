Dear Colleagues,

we are happy to announce an upcoming intensive workshop on phylogenetic
and comparative methods

Dates: December 5-7.

PLACE:  Stazione Zoologica A. Dohrn, Naples (Italy)

The workshop will include lectures on the theoretical aspects of
generating time-calibrated phylogenies, reconstructing trait evolution
and investigating rates of lineage diversification, as well as practical
tutorials. A brief description of the program is listed below. The number
of participants will be limited to 25, and admission is on a first
come, first served basis. No previous experience with R is necessary,
but students will be expected to have a basic understanding of molecular
evolution:

REGISTRATION: by email at sergio.stefanni@szn.it

FEES: 100€ (fees include lunches); special price at 50€ for students
enrolled at the Universities of Naples (Federico II and Parthenope)
with no lunch included

PARTICIPANTS: this workshop is preferentially addressed to PhD students,
postdocs and researchers with basic knowledge of phylogeny (sequence
alignments, nucleotide substitution models and basic tree building). Max
number 25

PROGRAM:

        Day 1
- Introduction to the use of phylogenies in comparative methods
- Introduction to Likelihood and bayesian phylogenetic inference
- Theory of molecular clocks
- Tutorial on relaxed clock node-dating
- Introduction to R

Day 2
- Tutorial on total-evidence dating
- Introduction to the use of remote servers (Cipres) for
  phylogenetic analyses
- Tutorial on comparative methods for exploring the evolution of
  discrete and continuous characters

Day 3
- Theory and approaches to the study of adaptive radiations
- Tutorials on comparative methods for detecting and quantifying
  heterogeneity in evolutionary rates

with best regards,
