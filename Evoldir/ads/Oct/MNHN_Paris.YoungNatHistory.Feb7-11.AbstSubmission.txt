The Bureau des Doctorants et ?????tudiants du Museum (BDEM: the
association of master and PhD students of the Museum national
d'Histoire naturelle), Doc'Up (the PhD students' association of
Sorbonne Universites), Timarcha (the naturalists' association of the
Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Jussieu Campus), and Symbiose 6 (the
biology students' association of the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie)
are pleased to announce that

registration and abstract submissions for the 4th Young Natural History
            Scientists' Meeting (YNHM) are now open!

The event will be hosted at the Museum national d'histoire naturelle
(MNHN) in Paris (France) from the 7th to the 11th of  February 2017.

This conference is dedicated to bringing together young researchers in
natural history from around the world (non-permanent researchers such
as master students, PhD students, and post-doctoral fellows); as such,
they will be the only ones allowed to present communications.
Nevertheless, senior researchers are very much welcome to attend. The
conference will be conducted entirely in English. No registration fees
are necessary, and travel grants for foreign students might be
available later on.

Please note that registration is mandatory whether you submit an
abstract or not, and even if you will not attend the entire conference.

Submissions close on the 4th of December 2016.

please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at ynhm2017@gmail.com.

See you soon! :-)
