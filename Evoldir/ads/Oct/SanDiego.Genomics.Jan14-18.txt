Dear Colleagues,

International Plant and Animal Genome XXV (PAGXXV)
January 14-18, 2017. San Diego, California, United States.
http://intlpag.org/

PAGXXV will bring together more than 3,000 leading researchers in plant and
animal research, over 130 exhibits, more than 150 workshops, over 1000
posters, and a computer demo track specifically designed to highlight
relevant software and online resources. PAG is the largest Ag-Genomics
meeting in the world.

If you work on digital resources that enable life sciences research, please
consider submitting an abstract to the PAG Computer Demonstration Track.
Computer demos are 15 or 20 minutes long, and are an excellent way to get
resources in front of the people who will benefit the most from them.

The Computer Demo abstract submission deadline is Friday October 28, 2016.

All computer demo presenters must be registered for the conference prior to
submitting.  Any software which is demonstrated at the PAG Conference must
also be available to the scientific community and non-commercial.

Visit http://www.intlpag.org/2017/abstracts/computer-demos for additional
information and follow the link to the submission form.

We hope to see you in San Diego!

Monica Munoz-Torres and Brian Smith-White
PAGXXV Computer Demo Track Co-Chairs
