Do you believe it is important to promote the public literacy on
evolution? Are you concerned about how evolution is reported in the
news? Are you an evolutionary biologist  passionate about your subject?

If the answer is YES, then join us at EvoKE 2017, in Porto, Portugal
from the 5th-8th of February 2017. This meeting, funded by ESEB, the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology, aims to initiate the
first European-wide discussion on evolution education and outreach
and pave the way towards new collaborative projects that will improve
the European public's literacy in evolution biology.

If you don't  have previous experience in science outreach, don't
worry!  Your expertise in evolutionary biology and your willingness to
participate will be the greatest contribution for the success of this
meeting!
