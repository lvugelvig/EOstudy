I International Symposium on Advances in Mussel Research (AMMR2016),
Vigo, Spain, 26-27 October 2016

Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the AMMR 2016 symposium, which will be held
at the University of Vigo =96 Faculty of Biology, Vigo (Spain).

This symposium aims to highlight the latest research on marine mussels
(Mytilus spp.) from a multidisciplinary perspective, including studies
from the fields of genomics, proteomics, immunology, physiology, ecology
and aquaculture among others. Marine mussels represent an excellent
study system in evolutionary biology, ecology, ecotoxicology, climate
change and more importantly, they are a key species in aquaculture,
being commercialised worldwide.

The symposium will include 7 talks from the invited speakers, 5 short
talks from participants and a poster session on Wednesday 26. On Thursday
27 we will have a boat trip to Cies Islands.
