It is our pleasure to invite you to the Neptune Evo Devo Symposium, which
will take place on 9th-11th November 2016 in Lisbon, Portugal.

The Neptune Evo Devo Symposium is organized by the Neptune Network
students, a Marie Curie-funded European project with focus on evo devo and
neurobiology of marine animal models.

Speakers will cover topics including evolution of the nervous system and
evolution of body plans. In line with Neptune's core interest, emphasis
will be put on marine organisms, though not exclusively, and on recent
technologies which are becoming increasingly suitable for use in non-model
organisms, e.g. CRISPR genome editing and Light Sheet Microscopy, enabling
broader comparative studies.

This symposium aims to attract enthusiastic, international scientists, as
well as to foster interactions between communities. It will be a friendly
event, in which participants will be able to present their work (short
talks or poster sessions) and to exchange with leading researchers.

programme, here:
