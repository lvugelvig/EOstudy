Dear all,

We would like to call your attention to our session "Ancient DNA for
understanding past biodiversity, human history, and drivers of ecosystem
changes: achievements, limits and perspectives" at the PAGES OSM
<http://www.pages-osm.org/> 2017 in Zaragoza, 9-13 May 2017.

The Open Science Meeting (OSM) and the associated Young Scientists Meeting
(YSM) <http://www.pages-osm.org/index.php/ysm> are the premier scientific
events of Past Global Changes (PAGES <http://www.pages-igbp.org/>), a core
project of Future Earth <http://futureearth.org/> and a scientific partner
of the World Climate Research Programme <http://www.wcrp-climate.org/>.
Our session will bring together researchers using aDNA from a variety
of archives (sediments, bones, ) to study the history of ecosystems
and populations in relation to climatic and anthropogenic factors. We
particularly welcome contributions showcasing methodological developments
of aDNA analyses to understand and account for taphonomic processes and
biases. Abstract submission is open until 20 December.

For more information, please visit:  http://www.pages-osm.org/   -
our session is number 33.

Looking forward to receiving your contributions and seeing you at the
PAGES OSM!

Best regards,
Charline Giguet-Covex, Laura Epp, Isabelle Domaizon, Inger Greve Alsos

33. Ancient DNA for understanding past biodiversity, human history,
and drivers of ecosystem changes: achievements, limits and perspectives
Co-conveners: Charline Giguet-Covex (University of York), Laura Epp

Recherche Agronomique) and Inger Greve Alsos (Troms√∏ University Museum)

Use of ancient DNA (aDNA) has made a major contribution to our
understanding of past ecosystems and human history. Recent studies
have for instance addressed ecosystem and population changes both in
relation to climatic and anthropogenic factors, as well as the history
of agro-pastoral activities. However, compared with other proxies, it
is still in its infancy in particular for its application to continuous
sedimentary records. Hence, whereas, in theory, it can offer to directly
identify organisms living in the surrounding of the archive down to
species level, and even capture intraspecific or morphologically cryptic
variants, we still know little about to what extent the biota is actually
represented in the DNA records. Especially, biases or imprecisions
related to both taphonomic processes and analytical procedures are not
yet fully understood.

In this session, we will bring together specialists using aDNA applied to
sediments and bones to study the history of ecosystems and populations in
different contexts (e.g. ecology, genetics, archaeology). In particular,
we welcome contributions showcasing methodological  developments of
aDNA analyses, to understand and account for taphonomic processes and
biases. Contributions integrating different kinds of data and considering
the different spatial and/or temporal scales of these analyses are also
highly appreciated.
