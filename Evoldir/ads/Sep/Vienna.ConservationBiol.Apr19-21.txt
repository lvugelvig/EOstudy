Dear colleagues,

the 10th Annual Meeting of the Specialist Group on Macroecology of the 
Ecological Society of Germany, Austria and Switzerland (GfO) will take 
place in Vienna (Austria) between the 19-21 April 2017. The meeting will 
be held under the theme "Macroecology in Space and Time".

This conference will cover a wide range of topics at the crossroads of 
conservation biology, biogeography, macroecology, evolution and global 
change. Suitable presentations may include various approaches and 
analytical methods that explain patterns of abundance, distribution and 
diversity from genes to ecosystems, and ecosystem services. We 
particularly encourage the submissions of interdisciplinary studies 
(including socio-ecological studies and studies on historical 
(palaeontological) biodiversity), submissions that propose novel 
approaches, and submissions that advance or test recent concepts and 
theories.

We especially encourage young and early career researchers to submit 
their abstracts. Submission deadline is the 1st December 2016. For more 
information and updates please check out the website

Best wishes,
The Organizing Committee
(Franz Essl, Bernd Lenzner, Stefan Dullinger)
