This course is being delivered by Dr Martin Jones, an expert in Python 
and author of two text books,

Python for Biologists 
[http://www.amazon.com/Python-Biologists-complete-programming-beginners/dp/1492346136/]

Advanced Python for Biologists 
[http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-Martin-Jones/dp/1495244377/].

Due to high demand a repeat of this course will run from 3rd - 7th 
October 2016 at Malham tarn field centre, Yorkshire, North of 
Manchester, England.

Course overview: Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a 
popular platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from simple 
one-off scripts to large, complex software projects. This workshop is 
aimed at complete beginners and assumes no prior programming experience. 
It gives an overview of the language with an emphasis on practical 
problem-solving, using examples and exercises drawn from various aspects 
of bioinformatics work. After completing the workshop, students should 
be in a position to (1) apply the skills they have learned to tackle 
problems in their own research and (2) continue their Python education 
in a self-directed way.
Intended audience:

This workshop is aimed at all researchers and technical workers with a 
background in biology who want to learn programming. The syllabus has 
been planned with complete beginners in mind; people with previous 
programming experience are welcome to attend as a refresher but may find 
the pace a bit slow.
Teaching format:

The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see the detailed 
curriculum below). Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture 
followed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks at the 
organizer's discretion. There will also be plenty of time for students 
to discuss their own problems and data.

Assumed background:
Students should have enough biological background to appreciate the 
examples and exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA and 
protein sequences, what translation is, and what introns and exons are). 
No previous programming experience or computer skills (beyond the 
ability to use a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a 
laptop with Python installed.
