ACCEPTING REGISTRATIONS for Taming the BEAST in the South Pacific

February 5th to February 10th 2017.

Application deadline: October 25th, 2016. See "Taming the BEAST in the
South Pacific" https://www.compevol.auckland.ac.nz/en/events.html for
registration and scholarship process details. 3 partial scholarships
are available for postgraduate students.

This 5-day comprehensive summer school will focus on the BEAST2 software
and is aimed at postgraduate students and early career researchers in the
life sciences. Speakers and tutorial instructors are leading experts in
the field and come from New Zealand, Australia and the UK. The location
of the summer school is on the beautiful Waiheke Island, a short ferry
ride from Auckland city centre, New Zealand.

The course combines lecture sessions, guided tutorials, and opportunities
to discuss the analysis of your own data with experts. The programme
is divided into daily themes which cover 1) Bayesian phylogenetics and
relaxed clocks; 2) phylodynamics: macroevolution and infectious disease;
3) species tree and gene trees; 4) plylogenetic model comparison, model
selection and model averaging and 5) phylogeography and trait evolution.

Taming the BEAST in the South Pacific is organised by the Centre for
Computational Evolution at the University of Auckland, and follows the
successful inaugural Taming the BEAST workshop in the Swiss Alps run by
ETH Zurich earlier this year.
