TiBE 2016 - TROPICAL BIODIVERSITY | November 28-29, 2016 @ CIBIO-InBIO,
Vairao, Portugal

TiBE, Trends in Biodiversity an Evolution, is an annual meeting
organized by CIBIO-InBIO, which aims to bring together senior
researchers, post-graduate and graduate students working on the field
of evolutionary biology to present and discuss cutting-edge findings in
relevant topics related with speciation, molecular evolution,
comparative genomics, population and conservation genetics research,
among others. Held in an informal but stimulating scientific
atmosphere, these conferences provide an excellent opportunity for
strong interaction and brainstorming between students and more
experienced researchers.

TiBE 2016 will be devoted to Tropical Biodiversity and we believe that
it will be an excellent opportunity to hear and share the work that is
being done in tropical areas. These conferences will take place
on November 28 - 29, 2016 at Campus de Vairao
(https://cibio.up.pt/venue-facilities), University of Porto, and will
be hosted by CIBIO-InBIO's Tropical Biology group - TROPBIO
