The students of the Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics are
proud to announce the fifth MIND THE GAP conference to be held on
October 31 and November 1, 2016 at the campus of Vetmeduni Vienna.

MIND THE GAP aims at bringing together theoretical and empirical
population geneticists. This conference is the fifth meeting in a
series of conferences held in Freiburg (2009), Plon (2010), Cologne
(2011), and Vienna (2013).

As in these past meetings, there are different main topics for this
conference. This year's themes are:

- Evolutionary inference using time series data
- Adaptive QTLs and their genomic signatures
- Phenotypic plasticity
- Introgression: signatures of selected and neutral alleles

The program is now online:

still being accepted. Details about registration can be found on our
