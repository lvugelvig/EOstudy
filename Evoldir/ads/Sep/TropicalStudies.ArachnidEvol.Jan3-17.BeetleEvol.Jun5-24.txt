Hello all,

(Apologies for cross-posting)

I wanted to let you about the course we are offering this academic year.

Graduate Courses 2016-2017:

Field Ecology: Skills for Science and Beyond (4 weeks, 29 Dec 2016 -
24 Jan 2017)
Deadline: October 10, 2017
Website link: http://bitly.com/FieldEcology

Tropical Biology: An Ecological Approach (6 weeks, 22 May - 2 July 2017)
Deadline: February 3, 2017
Website link: http://bit.ly/TropBio

The above two courses are our hallmark field ecology courses that
immerse graduate students in hypothesis-driven research learning. The
4-weekField Ecology in late December and January allows students to
fit in the course while still attending fall and spring terms at their
home campus.  The 6-weekTropical Biology, scheduled this year during
Summer Session 1, will provide more time during and after the course
to hone research skills.  Both courses include a science communication
workshop to share research through the production of podcasts and
videos. Please take a moment to view a video about these courses (click
