Explore the amazing world of tropical insects

BIO 380 Entomology is a 4 credit lab course designed to provide students
with an in-depth understanding of the systematics, ecology, behavior,
physiology, and evolution of one of the most important, and certainly
the most diverse group of organisms on Earth, the insects. The course
will be offered in Costa Rica at two world famous biological stations,
La Selva and Palo Verde, which represent contrasting Neotropical rain
and dry forests, respectively. The course will take place during the
winter inter‑session, January 2-22, 2017. It will include insect
identification, survey and collecting methods, basic field observation,
and experimentation techniques.

La Selva will serve as a base of operations for the course. It is an ideal
location because the station provides housing and meals, laboratory space,
microscopes, transportation to and from the airport in San Jose, and a
well‑marked trail system for students to carry out their collecting
and experiments. There is long tradition of entomological research at
La Selva and amazing resources (libraries, plant and insect collections,
local expertise) to carry out a class.

Undergraduate Tuition (subject to change) NY residents per credit: $270;
Non-residents per credit: $988 Program Fee: $3,200 (Includes housing, three
meals per day, group excursions, and international health insurance).
