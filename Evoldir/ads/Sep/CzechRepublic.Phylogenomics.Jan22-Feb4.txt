Workshop Overview:
The Workshop on Phylogenomics consists of a series of lectures,
demonstrations and computer laboratories that cover various aspects
of phylogenomic analysis. Faculty are chosen exclusively for their
effectiveness in teaching theory and practice. The course is designed
for established investigators, postdoctoral scholars, and advanced
graduate students. The Workshop is designed to provide lectures and
extensive hands-on laboratories on modern tools and techniques used
for the analysis of phylogenomic data. Lecturers and laboratories will
be given by a team of internationally recognized scholars. By the end
of the Workshop, participants will be familiar: Lectures and computer
laboratories total ~90 hours of scheduled instruction.

Topics to be covered include:
- The design and implementation of a full phylogenomic analysis
- Method selection for phylogenetic inference
- Estimation of divergence times
- Detection of selection on genomic scales
- Manipulate and construct large data matrices
- The value of using transcriptomic or genomic data for
  phylogenomic analysis
- The use of phylogenomics for species tree estimation
- Detection of horizontal gene transfer

Co-directors: Toni Gabaldon, Jordi Paps Montserrat, Guy Leonard, and
Scott A. Handley
