Course EvoS-2

organized by Filipa Vala| November 21-December 16 2016 @ Lisbon,
Portugal

Objectives: Evolutionary theory provides a framework for understanding
all living systems. Nevertheless, throughout the 20^th century, with a
few exceptions, evolutionary biologists have "avoided" using evolution
to address problems related to our own species. EvoS is a program
created by David Sloan Wilson at the University of Binghamton, and
later adopted at other faculties that have joined into the EvoS
international consortium. EvoS aims at turning evolutionary theory into
a common language to areas that pertain to the natural world, including
human affairs. This advanced course is part of the EvoS programme at
the University of Lisbon.
