Deadline is approaching for the upcoming BBASH Next Generation Sequencing
RNA-seq training workshop.

Course description
This course will provide an introduction to next generation sequencing
(NGS) platforms, data analysis and tools for data quality control, read
alignment (mapping), differential expression, de-novo and referenced based
transcriptome assembly, annotation and gene discovery of RNA sequencing
(RNA-Seq) data. The course will be delivered using a mixture of lectures
and computer based hands on practical sessions using real data.

This course is aimed at wet-lab biologists who are involved in research
projects that will require the handling and analysis of NGS data. A
significant proportion of the course will be computer-based using command
line tools in the Unix environment, therefore, in order to gain maximum
benefit from the course all attendees will be required to have basic
Unix skills.
