Dear all,

Registration is now open for the Symposium on the "Origins and Natural
History of the Scandinavian Biota" taking place 7-8 November 2016,
at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm.

The deadline for registration is on October 16th.

Scandinavia was covered by a large ice sheet during the last glacial
maximum, which means most modern-day animals, plants and humans have a
recent origin in the region. But their origins and subsequent history
have until recently remained unresolved.

The Swedish Museum of Natural History invites you to a symposium where
some of the world's leading researchers in genetics, paleobiology and
archaeology present the latest research results on the origins and
natural history of the Scandinavian biota.

The following speakers will present their research:
Inger Alsos - University of Tromsø
Ingela Bergman - Institute for Subarctic Landscape Research
Love Dalén - Swedish Museum of Natural History
Øystein Flagstad - Norwegian Institute for Nature Research
Anders Götherström - Stockholm University
Rolf Ims - University of Tromsø
Sven Isaksson - Stockholm University
Mattias Jakobsson - Uppsala University
Jan Storå - Stockholm University
Kristiina Tambets - Estonian Biocentre
Per Möller - Lund University
