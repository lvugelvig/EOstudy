Swedish Oikos Meeting 2017

Call for the submission of satellite symposium and workshop proposals

>From 7 to 9 February 2017 the 33rd Swedish national Oikos meeting
(http://oikos2017.event.lu.se) will be held in Lund. The meeting is open
to all ecologists and evolutionary biologists regardless of subdiscipline,
and we hope to have a wide breadth of talks and plenaries.

We would like to give the opportunity to attendees to organize satellite
symposia and workshops. This would be an excellent opportunity to have a
specialized meeting with colleagues from all over Sweden and abroad. The
submission of proposals is now open. Details on the submission process
can be found on our website:

Deadline for the submission is the 7th of October 2016. Registration
for the meeting itself will open later.
