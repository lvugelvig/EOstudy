21st Annual International Meeting on Microbial Genomes - September 18-22,
2016 at Lake Arrowhead, CA

This conference is part of a yearly meeting initiated in 1991 to bring
together genome sequencers, bioinformatics specialists, biologists, and
geneticists, to forge interactions that would result in meaningful
functional genomics.  The goal of the meeting is to translate the influx of
new genome sequencing information into useful biological studies.

The Lake Arrowhead 2016 meeting will have a major focus on microbial
communities, the human microbiome, pathogens, and genome evolution.  The
field of genomics has reached the point where deriving the sequence of an
organism=A2s entire genome is now seen as a beginning rather than an
endpoint.  The sequence itself is a powerful tool to guide further studies
to achieve an understanding of the organism=A2s biology.  This understandin=
g
requires either a detailed genetic analysis, or more rapid methods for
developing functional genomics.

Therefore, this years meeting will cover micro-organisms for which
extensive analyses exist, and those for which new biological and technical
strategies are being developed.  The focus on biodiversity, the human
microbiome, pathogenic organisms, and bioenergetics adds special
significance to this meeting.  This meeting is designed to have a mix of
invited presentations and poster sessions.  The meeting will have
approximately 150 participants.  Since attendance is limited, please
