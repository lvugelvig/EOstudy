Dear Evoldir community,

We would like to announce a fast-approaching symposium "EXPLOITATION AND
CHEATING IN MUTUALISM: SYNTHESES, CHALLENGES, & NEW DIRECTIONS" that is
open to the public in Paris, France, May 30 & 31st 2016. Our goal is to
look ahead into the future of cheating: diverse perspectives are welcome!

The website is:

and we have a form where you can sign-up to get updates before and
(especially) after the meeting:

This small symposium will be held May 30-31, 2016 at the Oceanographic
Institute (Maison des Océans et de la Biodiversité). This meeting is part
of the 2016 program of Pépinière interdisciplinaire CNRS "Eco-Evo-Devo"
hosted at Paris-Sciences-Lettres Research University. The meeting is also
supported by a grant from the Partner University Fund (France-America
Cultural Exchange) to École Normale Supérieure and the University of
Arizona.

Very best wishes,
Judie Bronstein, Megan Frederickson, Maren Friesen
