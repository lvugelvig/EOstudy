PoreCamp is a hands-on training course based around Oxford Nanopore
MinON sequencing technology. This is the second Porecamp to be run. t
is organised and run by researchers for researchers and is the next
installment in the PoreCamp series of courses. The last installment
was run in December 2015<http://porecamp.github.io/index.html> at the
University of Birmingham, UK.

The aim is to provide practical, hands-on experience of the technology to
enable any researcher with basic molecular biology expertise to perform
their own sequencing experiments and learn from some of the leading
experts in the field.

Date: Monday 15th August =96 Friday 19th August 2016

Location: Penryn Campus, Cornwall, University of Exeter, U.K.

Learning objectives:

  *   Preparing high quality MinON sequencing libraries
  *   MinON operation
  *   Custom scripts to maximise sequencer throughput
  *   nitial QC and analysis of MinON output
  *   Downstream analysis involving de-novo assembly and remapping
  *   Production of a dataset for several fungal genomes as part of the
  1000 fungal genomes project<http://1000.fungalgenomes.org/home/>.

DNA will be provided for those who would like work on the 1000 fungal
genomes project. Users will also be able to bring their own DNA samples
but we cannot guarantee data will be generated from these =96 please do
not rely on this event to generate data for your work. Further guidance
will be provided on this to successful applicants.
