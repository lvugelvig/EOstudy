Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the 2nd international meeting on

WILD PLANT PATHOSYSTEMS

29-31 August 2016, Helsinki

*Please remember to secure your place as the number of participants is 
limited!*

Conference registration & welcome reception take place on Sunday evening 
28 August. For those interested, we will organize a post-conference 
excursion to the Åland Islands to visit the classic metapopulation study 
system 1-3 September.

Research carried out on plant-pathogen interactions has provided 
breakthroughs in how ecological, molecular and evolutionary dynamics are 
coupled to produce the patterns on infection we observe in nature. This 
conference brings together scientists working in cutting edge areas of 
plant-pathogen interactions including coevolution, epidemiology, 
evolutionary genomics, pathogen movement across the agro-ecological 
interface and community level processes.

Registration opens on 14 March and closes on 31 May 2016. Please note 
that number of participants is limited and slots will be allocated on a 
first-come first-served basis. The registration fee is 250 euros (150 
euros MSc and PhD students).
