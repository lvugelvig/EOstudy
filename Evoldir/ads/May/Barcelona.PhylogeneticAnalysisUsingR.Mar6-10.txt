DearColleague,

Registrationis open for the fourth edition of the course PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
USINGR, March 6th-10th, 2017.

INSTRUCTORS:Dr. Emmanuel Paradis (Institut de Recherche pour le D¨¦veloppement,
France)and Dr. Klaus Schliep (University of Massachusetts, USA).

Moreinformation:
http://www.transmittingscience.org/courses/phylogeny/phylogenetic-analysis-using-r/

Thiscourse is for biologists dealing with the analysis of multiple molecular
sequencesat several levels: Populations, species, clades, communities. These
biologistsaddress questions relative to the evolutionary relationships among
thesesequences, as well as the evolutionary forces structuring biodiversity at
differentscales. The objectives are: (i) to learn the theorical bases
phylogeneticanalysis, (ii) to know how to choose a strategy of molecular data
analysisat the inter©\ or intraspecific levels, (iii) to be able to initiate a
phylogeneticanalysis starting from the files of molecular sequences until the
interpretationof the results and the graphics. The software used for this
coursewill be centered on the R language for statistics. This will include the
useof specialized packages particularly ape, phangorn, and adegenet.

Requeriments:Knowledge of multivariate statistics, phylogenetics and molecular
evolution.User level of R.

PLACE: Facilities of the Centre of Restauraci¨® i Interpretaci¨® Paleontologica,
ElsHostalets de Pierola,  Barcelona (Spain).

Organizedby: Transmitting Science, the Institut Catal¨¢ de Paleontologia M.
