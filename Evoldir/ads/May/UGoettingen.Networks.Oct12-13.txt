Dear colleagues and friends,
we are happy and proud to announce that the interdisciplinary symposium
'NETWORKS IN BIOLOGY' will take place October, 12th-13th 2016 at the
Georg-August-University Göttingen, Germany.

Networks are a common theme in all biological processes. Since the
organization and structure and thus the function of biological networks
can rarely be studied directly, different specialized approaches such as
mathematical modelling, empirical studies or the combination of those
are being developed in various biological disciplines. The main aim of
the 'NETWORKS IN BIOLOGY' symposium is to bring researchers of different
research fields together to reveal commonalities of different biological
networks and overlaps in the used methodology.

Invited Speakers:
DAMIEN FARINE (MPI for Ornithology, Konstanz, Germany)
MARC TIMME (MPI for Dynamics & Self-Organization, Göttingen, Germany)
JOHANNES JAEGER (Konrad-Lorenz Institute, Vienna, Austria)
STEFAN SCHEU (Department Animal Ecology, Göttingen, Germany)
ARNE TRAULSEN (MPI for Evolutionary Biology, Plön, Germany)
LAUREN BRENT (Centre Research Animal Behaviour, Uni Exeter, UK)
