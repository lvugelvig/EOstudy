RECOMB COMPARATIVE GENOMICS 2016, SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/Genomics16/index_e.php

SCOPE
The annual RECOMB Comparative Genomics Satellite Conference (RECOMB-CG)
brings together leading researchers in the mathematical, computational and
life sciences to discuss cutting edge research in comparative genomics,
with  an emphasis on computational approaches and the analysis of novel
experimental results. The program will include keynote talks, contributed
talks, and a poster session.

The 14th RECOMB-CG conference will be held in Montreal, Canada, October
11-14 2016. With this Call for Papers we invite high-quality original
full papers on topics related to the conference theme. The conference
will also have a poster session. A detailed call for posters will be
published later on the conference web page.

TOPICS
Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:
- genome evolution
- genome rearrangements
- genome variation, diversity and dynamics
- phylogenomics
- comparative tools for genome assembly
- population genomics
- comparison of functional networks
- comparative epigenomics
- paleogenomics
- cancer evolution genomics
- epidemiology
- gene identification and/or annotation

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper Submission Deadline: June 6, 2016
Author Notification: July 8, 2016
Final Version Due: July 22, 2016
Conference: October 11-14, 2016

DETAILS ON SUBMITTING MANUSCRIPTS
Submitted papers must have not been published or be currently under
consideration for publication in any other journal or conference with
formal proceedings. All accepted papers will have to be presented by
one of the authors at the conference.

Accepted papers will be published in one of three journals:
- a special issue of BMC Genomics, edited by a RECOMB-CG PC chair,
- a special issue of BMC Bioinformatics, edited by a RECOMB-CG PC chair,
- a special section of a regular issue of Bioinformatics (Oxford
  University Press), edited by a RECOMB-CG PC chair and a Bioinformatics
  Associate Editor.

As BMC Genomics and BMC Bioinformatics are Open Access journals, there
will be an author fee of pounds 922 (922 Pounds Sterling) for publication in
the event that an article is accepted in one of these two journals.

Papers accepted for presentation at the conference and considered
for publication in Bioinformatics will be subject to an extra round of
reviewing to ensure they meet the usual standards of the journal. Papers
appearing in Bioinformatics will be subject to the regular fees of
Bioinformatics for extra pages and colour figures for example.

Authors will need to indicate upon submission their preferred publication
option (BMC Genomics, BMC Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics). This preference
should be stated in the Abstract section of the Easychair submission page.

However, the final decision about the journal for each paper will be
taken by the RECOMB-CG PC chairs and communicated to the authors upon
acceptance.

Papers must be submitted in PDF format according to
the guidelines for authors of the respective journal:
https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript
http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/bioinformatics/for_authors/g
eneral.html Papers submitted in BMC format must be within 10 pages, while
papers submitted in Bioinformatics format must be limited to 7 pages. In
both cases a clearly marked appendix can be added to the submission that
contains supplementary material made available to the reviewers.

All submissions must be made online, through the
EasyChair submission system, at the following address:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recombcg2016 Authors need to
register on that web site before submitting. A standard PDF file must
be received by midnight on June 6, 2016 (any time  zone) in order for a
submission to be considered. Re-submission of already submitted papers
will be possible until midnight June 8, 2016 (any time zone).
