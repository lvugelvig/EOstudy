London_evolutionary_conflict_June_8th

Dear colleagues,

Registration for 2016 CEE (Centre for Ecology & Evolution
- https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cee)
Summer Symposium 2016 entitled: "War and peace: the dynamics of
evolutionary conflict" is open and there are still spaces remaining.

We are delighted to welcome 9 fantastic speakers from leading UK
research institutions:
Max Reuter - University College London
Judith Mank - University College London
Rebecca Dean - University College London
Ted Morrow - University of Sussex
Rhonda Snook - University of Sheffield
Stu Wigby - University of Oxford
Nina Wedell - University of Exeter
Tom Price - University of Liverpool
Susan Johnston - University of Edinburgh
The speakers will cover 4 main themes:

-   Intralocus and interlocus sexual conflicts
-   Intragenomic conflicts
-   Genomics of sexual dimorphism

This one-day conference will be held in the Sir Alexander Fleming
Building at Imperial College London, South Kensington, on June 8th.

As well as these 9 invited talks we also invite applications from PhD
students to give 3 short talks during the conference, and present
posters as well.  The focussed nature of this conference provides an
excellent opportunity for younger researchers to present and discuss
their work with leaders of the field. Indeed, it also serves as a good
practice run for much larger international conferences.

To register please visit the registration page linked below, and for
more info visit the event website.

Deadline for registration and abstract submission is May 20^th.

We look forward to seeing you on the 8^th June!

On behalf of the CEE Summer Symposium organisation committee.
