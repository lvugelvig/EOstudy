Dear All

for those working with SNP data, I would like to draw your attention
to a three day workshop from April 4--6,2017 on:

         "SNP data management with TheSNPpit software package"

organized at the Institute of Farm Animal Genetics (FLI) in
Mariensee near Hannover/Germany and run bei Helmut Lichtenberg and
myself.

TheSNPpit is a high performance database system for managing large
scale SNP data. (for detailed information see:
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164043 )

The workshop is targeted at people managing and analyzing SNP data from
various species and SNP arrays from possibly millions of samples.

The workshop will cover everything from software installation to hands on
use of TheSNPpit. Participants must bring their Linux laptops
together with their own SNP data.

Accommodation will be available locally. There is no course fee, but
participants will have to pay for their accommodation and meals.

For registration and questions get in touch by February 28, 2017.

Greetings
