Theme Session T22: Cenozoic Paleoecology, Paleogeography, and
Evolutionary History of Pacific Marine Life

https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017CD/top/index.epl

This session will focus on all environmental and evolutionary aspects
of the Cenozoic (66-0 Ma) history of marine life in the Pacific Ocean
at all temporal and spatial scales. It will include studies employing
evidence from paleoceanography as well as studies employing evidence
from the modern fauna. Of particular interest are studies on the
phylogeny of major taxa, paleoecological or evolutionary adaptations in
a changing marine environment, and the influence of changes in seawater
chemistry and temperature throughout the Cenozoic. Among other things,
we welcome studies that include the reconstruction of the history or
coral reef or molluscan communities. Paleobotany, molecular studies,
and micropaleontology are all meant to be included.
