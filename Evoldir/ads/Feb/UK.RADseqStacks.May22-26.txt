Hi evoldir,

We will be holding our annual RADseq/Stacks workshop at the Earlham
Institute (formerly TGAC) in Norwich, United Kingdom in May.

The course will be one week long, May 22-26, and will include a thorough
introduction to UNIX and subsequently Stacks, including sessions on the
RAD protocol as well as sessions analyzing several sets of RAD data
(with/without a reference genome, including population genetics and
phylogenetics subjects).

Instructors: Julian Catchen, Josie Paris and Konrad Paszkiewicz

The course is open to everyone with no prerequisites required. More
details can be found here:
