Dear Colleagues,

We would like to draw your attention to the Palaeogenomic
and Ancient DNA session being held at this years SEB
meeting in Gothenburg, Sweden from the 3rd - 6th July.
https://www.sebiology.org/events/event/seb-gothenburg/programme/cell-biology#dna

This session (5 and 6 July) will investigate the latest research in
palaeogenomics.  As samples are obtained from diverse sources, ranging
from sediments, permafrost, teeth, bones and preserved plant material,
we will also cover the challenges that arise when working with these
samples and introduce new techniques which have been employed to enhance
the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA samples.

Speakers include:

- Prof Michael Hofreiter (Universität Potsdam, Germany) - Sequencing
  and computational challenges in the analysis of ancient DNA
- Prof Terry Brown (University of Manchester, UK) - Using palaeogenomic
  approaches with plant remains.
- Prof Ludovic Orlando (Natural History Museum of Denmark) - Novel
  bioinformatic techniques in palaeogenomics
- Prof Inger Alsos Greve (Tromsø University Museum, Norway) - Flora
  reconstruction using metabarcoding from ancient sediments
- Dr Helena Malmström (Uppsala University, Sweden) - Population
  genomics of hunter-gatherers and farmers in Scandinavia
- Dr Mikkel Pedersen (Natural History Museum of Denmark) - Paleo-
  environmental reconstruction using ancient DNA from lake sediments

Abstract submission is now open
https://www.sebiology.org/events/event/seb-gothenburg/abstract and we
invite you to submit an abstract for either oral or poster presentation
(deadline 21 April 2017).

The SEB offers generous travel grants to support student
and early career scientist members to attend the meeting

We look forward to seeing you in Gothenburg
