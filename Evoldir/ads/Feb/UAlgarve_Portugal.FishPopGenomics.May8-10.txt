Dear Colleagues,

We are please to announce the Euromarine Forsight Workshop on The
Application of Population Genomics to Fisheries Management, at CCMAR,
University of Algarve from the 8-10th May, Faro, Portugal

Please take care the registration period will end by

March the 31st, 2017.

The workshop is designed to facilitate interaction and promote
synergistic activities aimed at improved stock monitoring, prediction,
and management to ensure sustainability in response to naturally- and
anthropogenically-induced changes to the marine environment.

There are three main themes:

1. Fish stock delineation and management
2. Population genomics and fisheries
3. The future of fisheries management in the genomic era

Five top scientists will give keynote talks that will set the debate,
followed by oral presentations given by the attendants. A discussion
among all participants will be conducted by a pivot/rapporteur to
produce a synthesis report.

Keynote speakers:

        - Gary Carvalho (Univ. Bangor, UK)

        - Stefano Mariani (Salford Univ., UK)

        - Ian R. Bradbury (DFO, Canada)

        - Jann T. Martinsohn (JRC, Italy)

        - Shawn Narun (CRPN, USA)
