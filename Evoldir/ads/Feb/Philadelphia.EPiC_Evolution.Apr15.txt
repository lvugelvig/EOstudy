*Description:* This conference aims to bring together early career
researchers from the greater Philadelphia area sharing similar interests in
understanding complex biological relationships that inform ecological and
evolutionary processes. The topics covered will be broad in scope and will
address questions in areas such as genome evolution, speciation and
adaptation, the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution, microbiomes and
symbiosis, and organismal response to changing environments.  The
conference will provide graduate students and postdocs the opportunity to
present their research to their peers and hopefully this will serve as a
forum to receive useful feedback from senior-level researchers. We hope to
build lasting research relationships and collaborations among researchers
with similar interests in the broader Philadelphia area. Breakfast, lunch
and an evening reception will be served.

*Schedule:*

- ASN Opening Plenary: Dr. Mary Caswell Stoddard, Princeton University

- Three sessions of oral presentations

- GSA Closing Plenary: Dr. Sarah Sander Lower, Cornell University

- Poster reception

There will be *cash prizes* for best student talk and poster sponsored by
the American Society of Naturalists

*This conference is available free of charge because of our generous
sponsors:

- American Society of Naturalists Regional Conference Award

- Genetics Society of America Trainee-Organized Symposia

We hope you will join us, it's going to be *EPiC*!
