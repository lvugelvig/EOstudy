>From June 5-9, 2017 the College of Sciences and Mathematics at Auburn
University will host the 4th Annual Bioinformatics Bootcamp   a
training workshop in genomics and computational biology for researchers
interested in working with modern genomic data resources.  The Bootcamp
is a week-long immersion experience in the command line, scripting,
data handling and software skills required to process and analyze data
from high-throughput sequencing experiments. Previous experience in
bioinformatics is not required; interactive lectures and group data
analysis activities will introduce participants to best practices in
sequencing experiment design and analysis including widely used methods
in genome and transcriptome assembly, annotation, differential expression
and variant analysis.

Instructors include: Les Goertzen, Scott Santos, Ken Halanych, Laurie
Stevison, Rita Graze, & Jamie Oaks

The 2017 Bootcamp will feature a keynote lecture by Dr. Nirav Merchant,
Director of The Biocomputing Facility at The University of Arizona.

The Bootcamp registration fee is $500. To apply, send a brief statement of
interest and two-page CV (as a single pdf) to bioinformatics@auburn.edu
by April 15, 2017. Additional information can be found at
