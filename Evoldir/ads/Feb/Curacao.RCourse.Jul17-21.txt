A gentle introduction to R for the biological sciences
July 17th-21st, 2017, Willemstad (Curacao)
Delivered by Dr. Dan Warren
http://www.transmittingscience.org/courses/statistics/gentle-introducti
on-r-biological-sciences/

This 5-day course will introduce students to the R statistical
programming environment. The main learning objective of the course is
to give students a basic skill set and familiarity with several of the
most used packages in the biological sciences. It is intended primarily
for users who have no experience in R, or who have performed a few
basic functions but wish to develop their skills. This course is not
aimed at students with extensive experience in R and it will not cover
the theory behind the ana lyses implemented.

A typical day of the course will include step-by-step examination of
pre-worked code examples as well as hands-on live-coding, so that
students develop their skills through interacting with R directly.
Students will learn to read in data, conduct common analyses, and
produce publication-quality plots and reports. The students will also
work independently on conducting analyses in order to produce a final
project using available data provided by the course organisers.
