** SMBE 2017 | Abstracts Extended to 15th February

By popular request, we have extended the abstract submission and award
applications deadline for the Annual Meeting of the Society for Molecular
Biology and Evolution (SMBE) 2017 to Wednesday, February 15, 11:59PM
(GMT).

We would also like you to know that the organizers of SMBE 2017
(http://mci-group.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8f41f38197339eb69a8a6daa2&id=ccb77ffef7&e=21532bf94c)
are aware of and monitoring the unprecedented travel restrictions
recently imposed for a 90-day period by executive order in the USA. We
are working on accommodations, such as the option for making posters
and slides available online, and we encourage scientists from the
affected nationalities to contact us at SMBE2017@mci-group.com.

We would like to emphasize that (1) SMBE has always been a very
international society and is a leader in promoting diversity among
its membership and meeting attendees, and (2) Austin, in particular,
is an inclusive and liberal city that welcomes people from around the
world. We are looking forward to welcoming you to Austin in July!
