Wildlife 70: a symposium on long-term research.

The symposium will be held during 1-4 May 2017 in Peterborough,
Ontario. The co-hosts are Trent University, Wildlife Conservation Society
Canada, and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. The
symposium is  about the importance of long-term ecological research in
Canada.We are fortunate that Charles Krebs and Marco Festa-Bianchet have
agreed to be keynote speakers, and we have also arranged a moderated
panel discussion between Bob Wayne and Brad White on the nature of
eastern wolves.

It will be a fun and interesting meeting. Registration has opened,
and we are still accepting abstracts for poster presentations. More
details, including some preliminary program information, can be seen
here https://www.wildlife70.com. There is a great lineup of invited
speakers. Please share with any colleagues and students who may be
interested.
