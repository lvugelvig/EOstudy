ECAL 2017 will showcase a wide range of topics in Artificial Life, bringing
together world-leading researchers to discuss the latest advances in the
synthesis and simulation of living systems. We are happy to announce that
our keynote speakers cover a wide variety of topics and include:

 - Bill Sellers (University of Manchester, UK): Reconstructing Ancient Life
using Virtual Robots
 - Csaba Pal (Biological Research Centre, Szeged, Hungary): Complex
adaptations in evolution
 - Frances Westall (CNRS, Orleans, France): Origin of life and Life on Mars
 - Nancy Nersessian (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA): Managing
Complexity: Modeling dynamics in integrative systems biology
 - Philippe Faure (Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France): Drug
addiction and alteration of decision making process
 - Sabine Hauert (University of Bristol, UK): Swarming nanomedicine

For this edition the special theme is "Artificial life and the scientific
method: Create, play, experiment, discover". We are inviting especially
contributions that investigate the use of computer simulations in the
scientific method, and/or the interactions between in silico, in vitro and
in vivo experiments. Other topics of interest include, but are not limited
to, the following aspects of Artificial Life:

 - Evolutionary dynamics
 - Ecological and social dynamics
 - Artificial chemistry, origins of life
 - Computational cellular biology/physiology/systems biology
 - Self-replication, self-repair and morphogenesis
 - Bio-inspired, cognitive and evolutionary robotics
 - Perception, cognition and behavior
 - Evolution of language, computational linguistics
 - Embodied, interactive systems
 - Collective dynamics of swarms
 - Complex dynamical systems and networks
 - Cellular automata and discrete dynamical systems
 - Economy/society/social media as living systems
 - Computational humanities/anthropology/archeology
 - Methodologies and tools for artificial life
 - Interactions between in silico/in vitro/in vivo experiments
 - Philosophical, epistemological and ethical issues
 - Artificial life and education
 - Artificial life-based art
 - Applications of artificial life
 - Living technologies

There are two options for submission: either full paper or extended
abstract. Note that the format is exactly the same for both options. The
differences reside in the number of pages and type of contents:

 - Full papers have an 8-page maximum length and should report on new,
unpublished work.
 - Extended abstracts are limited to a 2-page length and can report on
previously published work.

We encourage the use of LaTeX for the production of papers. Guidelines for
submission and template files can be found here:
http://project.inria.fr/ecal2017/submission-guidelines/ <
http://project.inria.fr/ecal2017/submission-guidelines/>

Color figures are possible. Each submission should be uploaded as a single
file, in PDF format only, to the Easy Chair system:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecal2017 <https://easychair.org/
conferences/?confìal2017>

All submissions will undergo a detailed peer review process. Full papers
will be reviewed for relevance, scientific quality, sound methodology and
use of appropriate analysis techniques. Abstracts will be reviewed for
relevance and quality.

Both papers and extended abstracts will be considered for oral or poster
presentation, without distinction between full papers and extended
abstracts.

Accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published by MIT Press as
open-access electronic proceedings.

Note: At least one author of every accepted paper or poster must be
registered 30 days prior to the conference, or the paper/poster will be
withdrawn.

Note: Workshop papers are managed separately from the main conference. To
submit a paper to a workshop, go to its own website, which will be listed
in the Workshops page.
