The New Phytologist Trust is excited to invite you to the second next
generation scientists event. Next generation scientists 2017 is an event
aimed exclusively at early career researchers (PhD students and post-docs
with up to five years' experience since gaining their PhD).

It will provide an opportunity for early career plant scientists to
present research, and network with their peers in a supportive and
inspiring environment. In addition to presentations from early career
researchers, there will be a series of plenary lectures from outstanding
international plant scientists, talks by the 2014 and 2015 Tansley Medal
winners Bill Anderegg and Alexander Jones, and workshops on getting
published and publication ethics.

Registration is free and includes meals, accommodation and a social
event. Some assistance with the cost of travel to the meeting will also
be provided. Places are limited, so please register early!

Application deadline: 27 April 2017
