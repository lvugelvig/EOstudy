Dear colleagues,

We are delighted to invite you to the 5th Toulouse Economics and Biology
Workshop, which will take place on June 1-2, 2017.

The theme is "The evolution and economics of the family". For this
5th edition of the Toulouse Biology and Economics workshop, we have
invited speakers from evolutionary biology, economics, and evolutionary
anthropology who have conducted research on the family. Areas of expertise
of invited speakers include empirical approaches to understanding
physiological, demographic, and behavioral responses to family living,
and theoretical modeling of sexual strategies, household preferences,
and reproduction.
