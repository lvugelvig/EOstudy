*Theme Session T22: *Cenozoic Paleoecology, Paleogeography, and
Evolutionary History of Pacific Marine Life
<https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017CD/top/index.epl>

This session will focus on all environmental and evolutionary aspects of
the Cenozoic (66-0 Ma) history of marine life in the Pacific Ocean at all
temporal and spatial scales. It will include studies employing evidence
from paleoceanography as well as studies employing evidence from the modern
fauna. Of particular interest are studies on the phylogeny of major taxa,
paleoecological or evolutionary adaptations in a changing marine
environment, and the influence of changes in seawater chemistry and
temperature throughout the Cenozoic. Among other things, we welcome studies
that include the reconstruction of the history or coral reef or molluscan
communities. Paleobotany, molecular studies, and micropaleontology are all
meant to be included.
