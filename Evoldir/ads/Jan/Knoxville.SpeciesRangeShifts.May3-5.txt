Call for applications:

Please consider applying to an Investigative Workshop on Species Range 
Shifts to be held at the National Institute of Mathematical and 
Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS), University of Tennessee, Knoxville, May 
3 - 5, 2017. Specifically, we will be discussing new methods for 
integrating niche models, [evolutionary] genetics, and fossil pollen 
data to understand species' range dynamics under changing climates. We 
hope this workshop will lead to several group papers as well as a 
long-term working group initiative at NIMBioS. Faculty, post-docs, and 
senior graduate students are welcome to apply.

If you are selected, your travel and accommodations are covered by NIMBioS.
