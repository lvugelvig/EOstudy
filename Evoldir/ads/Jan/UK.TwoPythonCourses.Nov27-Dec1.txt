INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON FOR BIOLOGISTS

http://www.prstatistics.com/course/introduction-to-python-for-biologists-ipyb04/

This course is being delivered by Dr Martin Jones, an expert in Python 
and author of two text books,

Python for Biologists 
[http://www.amazon.com/Python-Biologists-complete-programming-beginners/dp/1492346136/]

Advanced Python for Biologists 
[http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-Martin-Jones/dp/1495244377/].

Course overview: Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a 
popular platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from simple 
one-off scripts to large, complex software projects. This workshop is 
aimed at complete beginners and assumes no prior programming experience. 
It gives an overview of the language with an emphasis on practical 
problem-solving, using examples and exercises drawn from various aspects 
of bioinformatics work. After completing the workshop, students should 
be in a position to (1) apply the skills they have learned to tackle 
problems in their own research and (2) continue their Python education 
in a self-directed way.
Intended audience:

This workshop is aimed at all researchers and technical workers with a 
background in biology who want to learn programming. The syllabus has 
been planned with complete beginners in mind; people with previous 
programming experience are welcome to attend as a refresher but may find 
the pace a bit slow.
Teaching format:

The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see the detailed 
curriculum below). Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture 
followed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks at the 
organizer's discretion. There will also be plenty of time for students 
to discuss their own problems and data.

Assumed background:
Students should have enough biological background to appreciate the 
examples and exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA and 
protein sequences, what translation is, and what introns and exons are). 
No previous programming experience or computer skills (beyond the 
ability to use a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a 
laptop with Python installed.

DATA VISUALISATION AND MANIPULATION USING PYTHON

http://www.prstatistics.com/course/data-visualisation-and-manipulation-using-python-dvmp01/

This course is being delivered by Dr Martin Jones, an expert in Python 
and author of two text books,

Python for Biologists 
[http://www.amazon.com/Python-Biologists-complete-programming-beginners/dp/1492346136/]

Advanced Python for Biologists 
[http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-Martin-Jones/dp/1495244377/].

COURSE OVERVIEW:
One of the strengths of the Python language is the availability of 
mature, high-quality libraries for working with scientific data. 
Integration between the most popular libraries has lead to the concept 
of a "scientific Python stack": a collection of packages which are 
designed to work well together. In this workshop we will see how to 
leverage these libraries to efficiently work with and visualize large 
volumes of data.

INTENDED AUDIENCE:
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical workers with a 
background in biology and a basic knowledge of Python (if you've taken 
the Introductory Python course then you have the Python knowledge; if 
you're not sure whether you know enough Python to benefit from this 
course then just drop us an email).

TEACHING FORMAT:
The workshop is delivered over nine half-day sessions. Each session 
consists of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours of 
practical exercises, with breaks at the organiser's discretion. Each 
session uses examples and exercises that build on material from the 
previous one, so it's important that students attend all sessions. The 
last session will be kept free for students to work on their own 
datasets with the assistance of the instructor.

ASSUMED COMPUTER BACKGROUND:
Students should also have some basic Python experience (the Introduction 
to Python course will fulfil these requirements). Students should be 
familiar with the use of lists, loops, functions and conditions in 
Python and have written at least a few small programs from scratch.

Curriculum:
Day 1
Module 1: Introduction and datasets
Jupyter (formerly iPython) is a programming environment that is rapidly 
becoming the de facto standard for scientific data analysis. In this 
session we'll learn why Jupyter is so useful, covering its ability to 
mix notes and code, to render inline plots, charts and tables, to use 
custom styles and to create polished web pages. We'll also take a look 
at the datasets that we'll be investigating during the course and 
discuss the different types of data we encounter in bioinformatics work.

Module 2: Introduction to pandas
In this session we introduce the first part of the scientific Python 
stack: the pandas data manipulation package. We'll learn about Data 
frames   the core data structure that much of the rest of the course 
will rely on   and how they allow us to quickly select, sort, filter 
and summarize large datasets. We'll also see how to extend existing 
Data frames by writing functions to create new columns, as well as how 
to deal with common problems like missing or inconsistent values in 
datasets. We'll get our first look at data visualization by using 
pandas' built in plotting ability to investigate basic properties of 
our datasets.

Day 2
Module 3: Grouping and pivoting with pandas
This session continues our look at pandas with advanced uses of 
Dataframes that allow us to answer more complicated questions. We'll 
look two very powerful tools: grouping, which allows us to aggregate 
information in datasets, and pivoting/stacking, which allows us to 
flexibly rearrange data (a key step in preparing datasets for 
visualization). In this session we'll also go into more detail about 
pandas indexing system.

Module 4: Advanced manipulation with pandas
In this final session on the pandas library we'll look at a few common 
types of data manipulation   binning data (very useful for working 
with time series), carrying out principal component analysis, and 
creating networks. We'll also cover some features of pandas designed 
for working with specific types of data like timestamps and ordered 
categories.

Day 3
Module 5: Introduction to seaborn
This session introduces the seaborn charting library by showing how we 
can use it to investigate relationships between different variables in 
our datasets. Initially we concentrate on showing
distributions with histograms, scatter plots and regressions, as well as 
a few more exotic chart types like hexbins and KDE plots. We also cover 
heatmaps, in particular looking at how they lend themselves to 
displaying the type of aggregate data that we can generate with pandas.

Module 6: Categories in seaborn
This session is devoted to seaborn's primary use case: visualizing 
relationships across multiple categories in complex datasets. We see how 
we can use colour and shape to distinguish categories in single plots, 
and how these features work together with the pandas tools we 
havealready seen to allow us to very quickly explore a dataset. We 
continue by using seaborn to build small multiple or facet plots, 
separating categories by rows and columns. Finally, we look at chart 
types that are designed to show distributions across categories: box and 
violin plots, and the more exotic swarm and strip plots.

Day 4
Module 7: Customization with seaborn
For the final session on seaborn, we go over some common types of 
customization that can be tricky. To achieve very fine control over the 
style and layout of our plots, we'll learn how to work directly with 
axes and chart objects to implement things like custom heatmap labels, 
log axis scales, and sorted categories.

Module 8: Matplotlib
The final teaching session, we look at the library that both pandas and 
seaborn rely on for their charting tools: matplotlib. We'll see how by 
using matplotlib directly we can do things that would be impossible in 
pandas or seaborn, such as adding custom annotations to our charts. 
We'll also look at using matplotlib to build completely new, custom 
visualization by combining primitive shapes.

Day 5
Module 9: Data workshop
The session on the final day are set aside for a data workshop. Students 
can practice applying the tools they've learned to their own datasets 
with the help of an instructor, or continue to work on exercises from 
the previous day. There may also be time for some demonstrations of 
topics of particular interest, such as interactive visualization tools 
and animations.
