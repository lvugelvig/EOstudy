MCEB - Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary Biology 12-16 June
2017 - Porquerolles Island, South of France.

Webpage: http://www.lirmm.fr/mceb2017/

Pre-registration deadline: February 26th

Notification to applicants: March 17th

Final list of attendees: April 17th

Scope: Mathematical and computational tools and concepts form  an
essential basis for modern evolutionary studies. The goal of the MCEB
conference (at its 9th edition) is to bring together scientists with
diverse backgrounds to present recent advances and discuss open problems
in the field of mathematical and computational evolutionary biology.
The theme of this year's edition will be "Methods for integrative
evolutionary biology: various sources of data, various scales of
evolution", which includes the analysis of heterogeneous data (molecular,
phenotypic, ecological...), different time scales (from recent times to
the origin of life), different spatial scales (from local to worldwide
range), the combination of phylogenetics and population genetics,
multidisciplinary approaches, etc.. General concepts, models, methods
and algorithms will also be presented and discussed, just as during the
previous conference editions.

Where and when: Porquerolles Island, near Hyeres, in the South of 
France, 12-16 June 2017.

Cost: Conference fees including accommodation for four nights, meals,
coffee breaks, etc., will be around 450euro, all inclusive. PhD students
and postdocs would benefit of financial support.
