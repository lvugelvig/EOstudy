Dear all,

We are happy to announce that 2017 SHOW meeting will be held in Lund,
Sweden during 9 - 10th of March!

The meeting will take place in the Ecology building (Sölvegatan 37)
which is located northeast of the city centre. It takes between 10-15
minutes to get there by bus from the centre, or 30 minutes by walking. The
preliminary schedule for the meeting is:

Wednesday, 8th March:
Informal meet-up at restaurant Inferno in downtown Lund
Thursday, 9th March:
9-12: talks
13-16: talks
16-17: poster presentations
Evening: conference dinner at restaurant Hardings in Marieholm (town
located close to Lund)
Friday, 10th March:
9-12: talks
13-15: workshop/group discussion
16: meeting closes

As usual, we will reserve the last session on Friday for
discussion/workshop and we are grateful for suggestions and ideas for
discussion topics, and thoughts on what the meeting should focus on.

The dinner venue is Hardings in Marieholm, a small town in the
countryside, less than 20 minutes train ride from Lund. Since this
involves additional travel expense (approximately 100 SEK return fee),
we have decided to make the dinner optional. Thus, the registration
fee without the conference dinner will be slightly less expensive
(300 SEK) than with (450 SEK). Alcohol with dinner is purchased
separately by cash or card - Hardings sells wine, cocktails,
locally brewed beer, and has a decent selection of whiskey and
rum. Tickets to and from Marieholm can easily be purchased at the
time of travel or in advance through the Skånetrafiken app (Android:

Travelling to Lund by airport is very convenient, since Kastrup airport
(in Copenhagen, Denmark) is just across the bridge. Trains from Kastrup
airport to Sweden depart every 20 minutes and takes around 40-50 minutes
to Lund.

There are several places to stay in Lund, and most
of them are located in the city center, like for
example these two hotels: http://www.concordia.se/en.aspx

to the Ecology building where the meeting is held, at Hotel Ideon:

reservation at your preferred hotel/hostel.
