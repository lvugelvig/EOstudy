NGS'17: Structural Variation and Population Genomics, 3-5 April 2017,
Barcelona, Spain

Hosted by the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB)
and the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), the Next-generation
sequencing conference covers a broad range of topics in genome
sequencing and analysis. Our particular focus areas in 2017 are
structural variation and population genomics.

New sequencing technologies have opened up the possibility to sequence
genomes at a previously unprecedented scale. The sequencing of whole
genomes from large number of individuals representing multiple
populations allows the extent of genetic diversity, of both at the
single nucleotide level, and of larger structural variants, to be
catalogued. Using such data the genetic basis of evolutionary and
disease processes can be explored. The meeting will draw together
researchers from diverse backgrounds who develop and apply novel tools
to sequencing data. Topics covered will include, but are not limited
to, genome assembly, variant characterization and analysis, gene
expression, population history, disease, and more!

The conference program will be a combination of keynote talks from
renown scientists with research focusing on structural variation and
population genomics, a selection of thought-provoking submitted
abstract talks, technology and applications talks, as well as posters.
