24-26 May 2017

Mantua, Italy

International workshop of the Life project "Monitoring Insects with
Public Participation"From 24th to 26th May 2017 the concluding workshop
"Monitoring of saproxylic beetles and other insects protected in the
European Union" will be held in Mantua (Italy).

The project LIFE11 NAT/IT/000252 (Monitoring Insects with Public
Participation - MIPP) is developing national guidelines for the
monitoring of five saproxylic beetles species (Osmoderma
eremita, Lucanus cervus, Cerambyx cerdo, Rosalia alpina and Morimus
asper/funereus) listed in the Habitats Directive. One innovative method
tested is the use of a "molecular dog" to detect Osmoderma eremita.
The MIPP project is also applying a citizen science approach for the
mapping of rare insects in Italy: people collaborated with
scientists. The workshop is open to anyone interested in entomology and
in particular in: monitoring protocols, conservation and management,
habitats and biodiversity, citizen science.

The workshop is organized by the National Center for Study and
Conservation of the Forest Biodiversity "Bosco Fontana" in partnership
with the Universities of Roma "Sapienza" and "Roma Tre", the Council
for the Research in Agriculture, the Ministry for the Environment and
the Lombardy Region. Registration is free and the workshop is open to
80 attendees.
