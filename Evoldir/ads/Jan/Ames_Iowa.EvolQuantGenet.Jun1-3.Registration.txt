Each year, AGA symposia bring together 80-100 participants in a relaxed
and collegial setting to share ideas on genetic and genomic research
topics.

This year's meeting is AGA2017: Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics
in the Wild.  Hosted by AGA President Anne Bronikowski, it will be
held on the campus of Iowa State University.  The opening reception
on 1 June will be in the beautiful Reiman Gardens and Butterfly House:
