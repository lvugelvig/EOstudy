Dear Colleagues,

We are excited to invite you to submit abstracts and attend our ESEB2017
symposium [S5] on "*Evolutionary Biology of Ageing: integrating function
and mechanism*".

The symposium will take place at the 16th Congress of the European Society
for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), in Groningen, Netherlands, 20-25 August
2017. The deadline for abstract submission is_*January 10, 2017*_.

Less than a week left for abstract submission!!

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION:
Ageing is an almost ubiquitous feature of living organisms but its 
evolution and mechanistic basis are still poorly understood. The rapid 
advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of ageing pose 
new challenges for our understanding of ageing evolution, and have 
created an urgent need for the integration of recent empirical insights 
with an evolutionary framework of senescence and lifespan. Thus the 
ambition of this symposium is to address the integration of function and 
mechanism in our understanding of the process and evolution of 
senescence, both from an empirical and a theoretical point of view. In 
addition, we aim for a perspectives paper by the organizers together 
with the speakers. Questions of interest include: Does the evolution of 
ageing depend on the mechanisms mediating senescence and death, and if 
so - how? Is the trade-off between reproduction and survival 
indispensable for our understanding of the biology of ageing? How 
important are condition-dependent and true extrinsic mortality rates for 
the evolution of ageing? How and why do developmental processes and 
growth affect the evolution of senescence? What do state-dependent (i.e. 
sex-specific or caste-specific) ageing patterns tell us about ageing in 
general?
