The FSBI celebrates its 50^th Anniversary in 2017, and to commemorate
this landmark we are delighted to announce an International Symposium
covering many aspects of fish biology under the broad theme of
Understanding Fish Populations, to be hosted at the University of
Exeter, UK, 3-7 July 2017.

Included under this broad and diverse overarching subject are multiple
sub-themes relating to the fields of evolutionary biology, and we
welcome you to join us in presenting research on:

 1. Biology of Fish: from the Individual to Populations
       + Genes, genomes and epigenomes

 2. Fish in a Changing World
       + Evolutionary adaptations
 3. Tools for Understanding and Managing Fish Populations
       + Genetics, genomics and eDNA

The Call for Abstracts for FSBI17, to be held in Exeter (UK) on 3-7
July 2017, are open:
