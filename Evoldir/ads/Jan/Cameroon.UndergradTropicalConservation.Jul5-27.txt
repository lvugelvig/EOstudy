Course objectives:
The overall aim of this program is to provide training in the
fundamentals of tropical field research. A total of 20 undergraduate
students will participate in this course, half of which will be from
U.S. institutions and the other half from Cameroonian and Equato-Guinean
universities. Students will work collaboratively in teams to:

- Design an independent research project in tropical ecology
- Collect data and analyze results
- Write a report in the format of a scientific publication summarizing
  the aims, methods, results and conclusions of the research project
- Present project findings to participants and instructors at the end of
  the course

By participating in this program, students will:

- Understand the basic principles of conservation biology and evaluate
  how these principles are applied to problems in conservation
- Read the assigned literature and be able to critically assess the key
  concepts in a discussion and written format
- Demonstrate how to research data, work through spread-sheet exercises
  and manipulate software applicable to solving conservation problems
- Co-design an original research project and work effectively as a team
  member in a group environment
- Demonstrate an ability to effectively communicate research findings
  and key concepts through both oral and written presentation

Requirements:
- Currently registered as an undergraduate at a U.S. institution
- Participate in mandatory 3-week online seminar prior to the program
- One semester of college-level French (Recommended)
- Hold a valid passport
- Obtain all necessary vaccinations
- Enjoy working in a multi-cultural setting
- Able to work under physically strenuous conditions
- All travel expenses (flight, lodging, meals) will be covered

This course is optionally available for two credits (applicable course
