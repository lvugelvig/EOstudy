Dear Colleagues,

The Natural History Museum (London, UK) together with the Malacological
Society of London is hosting a symposium, "Molluscan Colour and Vision" to
be held on the 27th of April 2017 at the Natural History Museum.

 
The phylum Mollusca is highly speciose and is the largest phylum in the
marine realm. Many species are brightly coloured and patterned and yet
nearly all molluscs are thought to be colour blind. Despite their
limitations with colour vision, molluscs showcase a myriad of different
eye types, many of which are unique in the animal kingdom. In this
symposium speakers will cover a range of topics that highlight the
extraordinary nature of colour and vision in molluscs.
