SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION
[S12] Environmental effects on sexual selection

Sexual selection plays an important role in the evolution of novel
traits and can both enhance and delay the rate of adaptation to changing
environments. As for all other traits, the evolution of sexual traits
depends on three factors: variation in trait expression, heritability
of this variation, and the association of traits with reproductive
output. However, specifically in the case of sexual selection
environmental variation and selection pressures (mate choice and
competition) can interact to shape the evolutionary dynamics of secondary
sexual traits. It is currently widely debated how environmental change
will affect sexual selection and, inversely, what the role of sexual
selection is in adaptation to a new environment In a time of major
environmental change, these questions are particularly important. We
encourage submission of a diversity of studies (descriptive, experimental,
theoretical) that address the influence of spatial or temporal variation
of environmental conditions on the expression of sexual traits, their
heritability, or their selective advantage. We aim to cover a wide range
of methodological approaches, systems and modalities to facilitate
a lively exchange about how to study and understand the magnitude of
environmental effects on sexual selection.
