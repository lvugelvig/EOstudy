Dear colleagues,

I would like to draw your attention to the upcoming BioSyst.EU 
conference in August 2017 in Sweden, Gothenburg, where we will organize 
a half-day symposium on "DNA-barcoding and the future of biodiversity 
monitoring", with a special focus on metabarcoding approaches for 
biodiversity monitoring.

We are aiming at bringing together the experts on this topic and would 
like to cover as many aspects as possible in a balanced fashion - given 
the time limitation for approx. 1 plenary talk and 8 regular talks. 
There is of course room for poster contributions as well.

Registration for presentations closes at February 1st. It would be great 
if you let us know if you are interested in bringing the audience up to 
date with the latest findings from your field of research.

Application for presenters is done by sending an e-mail to

BioSyst2017abstracts@gmail.com.

The e-mail should contain the following information:
-Which symposium you would prefer to be assigned to
-The title of your presentation
-If it is an Oral presentation or Poster
-An abstract in either doc/pdf/txt -format.

Please find further details on the conference here:
