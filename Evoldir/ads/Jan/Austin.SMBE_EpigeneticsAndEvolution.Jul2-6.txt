SMBE 2017 Symposium "Epigenetics and Evolution"

We are pleased to announce a symposium on "Epigenetics and Evolution" at
SMBE 2017 in Austin, Texas, this July. Our invited speakers are Isabel
Mendizabal (Georgia Institute of Technology) and Damon Lisch (Purdue
University). Abstract submissions for contributed talks and posters are
welcome and due on 1 February 2017. Please use the following link for
submission: http://www.smbe2017.org/abstracts/. Note that abstract
submission is possible prior to registration for the conference.

Symposium description:

***
The quote from Dhobzhansky ("Nothing makes sense in biology except in the
light of evolution") is overused. But there may be no current area of
biology to which this quote is more pertinent than epigenetics. In many
respects, the study of epigenetics has been a sterling success. Geneticists
and molecular biologists have unraveled some of the intricacies of
epigenetic pathways and the interplay of epigenetics with development. And
yet, without the tools and context of evolutionary biology, it is difficult
to put these findings into a proper context. Evolutionary comparisons
provide a filter to help determine what phenomena are conserved, general,
and important over time. In this symposium, we seek to integrate epigenetic
information into an evolutionary framework, including the effects of
epigenetics on development, phenotype, and genome evolution.
