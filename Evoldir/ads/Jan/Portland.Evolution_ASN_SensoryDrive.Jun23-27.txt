The American Society of Naturalists is seeking 5-minute lightning talks
for a Spotlight Session at the Evolution2017 meetings dedicated to the
topic of ?25 Years of Sensory Drive?.   In 1992, the American Naturalist
published a supplemental issue on the topic of 'Sensory Drive' organized
by John Endler.? This issue featured a number of influential papers
that emphasized the role of the environment, phylogenetic history, and
development on the evolution and functioning of sensory systems. This
supplement introduced many ecologists and evolutionary biologists to the
intriguing and well-developed topic of sensory ecology.? In this spotlight
session, we will consider the role of sensory drive as a guiding framework
in ecological and evolutionary studies of communication systems over the
past 25 years, and the extent to which it serves as a useful framework
going forward.

The format of Spotlight Sessions is the following: 
1 15-minute talk
3 5-minute lightning talks
1 15-minute talk
3  5-minute lightning talks
1 15-minute talk

Confirmed Speakers include Molly Cummings (University of Texas at
Austin) and Leo Fleishman (Union College).  People who give 5-minute
lightning talks may also give a 15-minute talk in a regular session.
We seek speakers from a diversity of institutions and career stages
(including graduate students).

Those interested in participating should e-mail Becky Fuller
