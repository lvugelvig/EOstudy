I am excited to solicit applications for 5-minute "lightning talks" for a
Spotlight Session on "Speciation with and without sex chromosomes" to be
held at the upcoming SSE conference in Portland OR, June 23-27, 2017.

Session description: Studies of the genetics of speciation frequently focus
on sex chromosomes. In fact, the "two rules of speciation" (Coyne & Orr
1989) are both based on sex chromosomes. In this symposium we address how
sex chromosomes affect speciation and explore how speciation mechanisms may
be different in the wide diversity of taxa lacking sex chromosomes.

This is a new format for SSE and each Spotlight Session will include three
standard 15-minute talks interspersed with six 5-minute talks.
Unfortunately, there are no funds to offset travel or meeting costs. Those
who give 5-minute Spotlight talks will also be permitted to register for a
15-minute talk in a regular session.

Confirmed 15-minute spotlight speakers: Suzanne Edmands (University of
Southern California), Norman Johnson (University of Massachusetts,
Amherst), Nicole Valenzuela (Iowa State University)

If you are potentially interested in giving a 5-minute talk in this
session, please contact me (sedmands@usc.edu) by Jan 31, 2017. I will let
you know if you are selected by March 15 and you would then register on the
SSE website (early registration deadline is April 15, 2017).

All the best,

Suzanne Edmands
