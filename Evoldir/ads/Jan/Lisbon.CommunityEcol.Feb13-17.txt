cE3c - Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes is
organizing the Advanced Course Applied Methods in Community Ecology and
Functional Ecology by Paulo A. V. Borges & François Rigal - February

Applied Methods in Community Ecology and Functional Ecology

OBJECTIVES: This five-days intensive course is mostly a practical
course offering an overview on different community ecology and
macroecological methods and software. These will include all steps
of a research project, from the optimal sampling of communities to
process inference from large-scale patterns of taxon, phylogenetic and
functional diversity. Specific topics will be: (1) alpha, beta and
gamma diversity; (2) estimating diversity from incomplete sampling;
(3) partitioning taxonomic beta diversity; (4) community-assembly rules,
(5) functional and phylogenetic diversity, (6) null models, (7) rarity
and species abundance distribution. Finally, students will be asked to
present own data and case studies.
