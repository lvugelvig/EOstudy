Dear Colleagues:

We are inviting proposals for symposia for the 1st Asian Evolutionary
Conference to be held at Shenzhen, China on April 18th-20th. The
currently confirmed speakers include, Shigeru Kuratani (RIKEN),
Wen-Hsiung Li (Academia Sinica), Manyuan Long (University of Chicago),
Nori Satoh (Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology), Zhonghe Zhou
(Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology), Xing Xu
(Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology).

We launch this platform to connect Asian researchers to the rest of the
world for their common interest in evolution. We expect the conference
to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration among countries,
particularly to nurture the new generation of evolutionary scientists.

The selected symposia will receive substantial financial support to
cover at most three invited speakers' registration, travel and
accommodation. To encourage young researchers to attend the conference,
we will also offer fellowships for five postdocs and five PhD students.

The symposium submission deadline is August 15th, 2017. More details of
the conference can be found at http://www.asianevo.org/html/index.html
