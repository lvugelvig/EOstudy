"Intro to Eukaryotic Metabarcoding"
Delivered by Dr. Owen Wangensteen an expert in eukaryotic
metabarcoding.

https://www.prinformatics.com/course/eukaryotic-metabarcoding-eukb01/
This course will run from 23rd - 28th July 2018 at Margam Discovery
Centre, Wales.

Prices start at £400 (approx. 450 euros), accommodation packages
available for £260 (approx. 295 euros)
Metabarcoding techniques are a set of novel genetic tools for assessing
biodiversity of natural communities. Their potential applications
include (but are not limited to) accurate water quality, soil diversity
assessment, trophic analyses of digestive contents, early detection of
non-indigenous species, studies of global ecological patterns and
biomonitoring of anthropogenic impacts. This course will give an
overview of metabarcoding procedures with an emphasis on practical
problem-solving and hands-on work using analysis pipelines on real
datasets. After completing the course, students should be in a position
to (1) understand the potential and capabilities of metabarcoding, (2)
run complete analyses of metabarcoding pipelines and obtain diversity
inventories and ecologically interpretable data from raw
next-generation sequence data and (3) design their own metabarcoding
projects, using bespoke primer sets and custom reference databases. All
course materials (including copies of presentations, practical
exercises, data files, and example scripts prepared by the instructing
team) will be provided electronically to participants.

Course content is as follows full syllabus available on the course
