RECOMB Comparative Genomics 2017

SCOPE
The annual RECOMB Comparative Genomics Satellite Conference (RECOMB-CG)
brings together leading researchers in the mathematical, computational and
life sciences to discuss cutting edge research in comparative genomics,
with an emphasis on computational approaches and the analysis of novel
experimental results. The program will include keynote talks, contributed
talks, and a poster session.

The 15th RECOMB-CG conference will be held in the Centre for Genomic
Regulation (CRG), Barcelona, Spain, on October 04-06 2017. With this
Call for Papers we invite high-quality original full papers on topics
related to the conference theme. The conference will also have a poster
session. A detailed call for posters will be published later on the
conference web page:

DETAILS ON SUBMITTING MANUSCRIPTS
Submitted papers must have not been published or be currently under
consideration for publication in any other journal or conference with
formal proceedings. Each accepted paper has to be presented by one of
the authors at the conference.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, a volume
in the Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI) series.  In addition,
authors of selected papers will be invited, but not required, to
submit a significantly extended version of their papers to PeerJ,
BMC Bioinformatics, or BMC Genomics. Papers submitted to PeerJ will
be assigned to an Academic Editor of the journal and will be reviewed
according to the normal PeerJ standards. Papers submitted to BMC
Bioinformatics or BMC Genomics will be handled by the Program Committee
co-chairs. Authors who choose to publish their extended manuscripts
in one of these journals will have to pay the journal’s publication
fees. Authors are encouraged to submit their manuscripts in PDF format
according to the LNBI series guidelines:

http://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines

Submitted papers must be within 15 pages (in the LNBI format), with
optionally a clearly marked appendix containing supplementary material
made available to the reviewers.  All submissions must be made online,
through the EasyChair submission system, at the following address:

 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recombcg17
 
Authors need to register on that web site before submitting. A standard
PDF file must be received by midnight on June 18, 2017 (any time zone)
in order for a submission to be considered. Re-submission of already
submitted papers will be possible until midnight June 18, 2017 (any
time zone).
