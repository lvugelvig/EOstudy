This year's topic is NGS in medical research, including subjects like:

1. Introduction to Linux
2. Introduction to next-generation sequencing
3. RNA-Seq: gene expression estimation, differential expression
4. microRNA studies
5. ChIP-Seq data analysis
6. CLIP-Seq in medical studies
7. Genome variant calling
8. Roche sequencing
9. Bioinformatics of rare mendelian disorders
10.Medical applications of Nanopore sequencer

 The workshop is suitable both for beginners and for those who already have
 some basic knowledge in computational biology and find it necessary and
 interesting to learn more about bioinformatic applications related to Next
Generation Sequencing in medical research.
 Our school consists of lectures and hands-on - this combination should fit
