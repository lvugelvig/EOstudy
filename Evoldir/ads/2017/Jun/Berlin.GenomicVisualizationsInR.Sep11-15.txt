Dear all,

we still have a few spots available for the Workshop "Genomic Data
Visualization and Interpretation".

11th-15th September, Berlin (Germany)

https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course14/

Topic: Advanced R and bioinformatics applications for visualization and
interpretation of genomic data.

Length: 5 days (~ 9.30 AM to 5.30 PM with breaks)

Instructors: Dr Obi Griffith and Dr Malachi Griffith (Washington
University School of Medicine)

Course overview

The advent of rapid and relatively cheap massively parallel sequencing
has dramatically increased the availability of genome, transcriptome,
and epigenome profiling. Analysis workflows and published best practices
are also now available to process raw sequence data into alignments,
variant calls, expression estimates, etc., in relatively standardized file
formats. Interpretation and visualization of these data, often consisting
of thousands to billions of data points, and extracting biological meaning
remains a serious challenge. In this workshop we will explore a number
of best-in-class visualization tools, and provide working examples that
demonstrate important principles of 'omic interpretation strategies.

Workshop format

The workshop will be delivered over the course of five days. Each
day will include an introductory lecture with class discussion of key
concepts. The remainder of each day will consist of practical hands-on
sessions. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring
exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying
these skills on your own to complete complete individual exercises. After
and during each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as
a group. Computing will be done using a combination of tools installed on
the attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed via web browser.

Who should attend

This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical workers who are
analyzing some kind of omic data (e.g. WGS, exome, RNA-seq, variant
files, etc.). Examples demonstrated in this course will involve primarily
human genome/transcriptome data but many of the concepts learned will
be applicable to model organisms, metagenomics, simulated data, etc.

Requirements

Attendees should have a background in biology and a basic knowledge of
R. We will dedicate one session to a brief R/linux primer. Attendees
should have also some familiarity with genomic data. The course will
teach relatively advanced usage of R (especially ggplot2 and Bioconductor
packages). Attendees should have a working installation of R and RStudio
on their laptop.

Example data

Attendees will learn to visualize and interpret results from real human
genome data sets generated at the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington
University School of Medicine. These data will be analyzed to determine
previously known as well as potentially novel interpretations. Since the
example data are not simulated or arbitrarily filtered, interpretation and
visualization will be performed in the context of representative levels
of sequence error, and other sources of technical and biological noise.
