BACKGROUND
Within the scope of the DFG funded Virtual Fish Project at University
of Siegen (Germany), we developed the free and open-source "FishSim
Animation Toolchain" (FishSim) which combines easy creation,
animation and presentation of realistic 3D computer-animated fish
stimuli for the use in experiments with live test fish (Müller
et al. 2016, doi: 10.1093/cz/zow106; Gierszewski et al. 2016, doi:
10.1093/cz/zow108). FishSim was specifically designed for behavioral
experiments using common one-choice and two-choice set-ups, as in
studies on visual signaling and mate choice. FishSim provides various
possibilities to experimentally manipulate morphology and behavior of any
number of virtual 3D fish with presentation via monitors. Since FishSim
is based on a computer game engine, it offers a unique way for animating
3D fish via real-time input from an external video-game controller.

To introduce FishSim and to assist in the implementation of our
toolchain, we would like to welcome you to join a 3-day international
workshop for behavioral biologists on "Discovering FishSim in 3 days
- new software for computer-animated 3D fish stimuli for innovative
research in animal behavior". The workshop will be held at University
of Siegen in Siegen, Germany, from October 20-22, 2017, and is organized
by Dipl.-Biol. Stefanie Gierszewski (Institute of Biology, University of
Siegen), Prof. Dr. Klaudia Witte (Institute of Biology, University of
Siegen), Dipl.-Inform. Klaus Müller (Institute of Real-Time Learning
Systems, University of Siegen) and BSc. Jan-Marco Hütwohl (Institute
of Real-Time Learning Systems, University of Siegen).

The goal of this 3-day workshop is to provide detailed information
on the free and open-source FishSim Basic and its integrated tools
FishCreator, FishSteering and FishPlayer in both theory and practice. DOs
and DON'Ts for implementation of FishSim Basic in future research are
discussed. Working computers with all software installed will be provided
but it is also possible to use personal laptops. Assistance and advice
for working with own data will be given.

Please visit our website https://virtualfishproject.wixsite.com/fishsim
for more information about the software, the preliminary program and
the application procedure.

We hope to welcome you in Siegen! 

Cheers,
The Organizing Team
