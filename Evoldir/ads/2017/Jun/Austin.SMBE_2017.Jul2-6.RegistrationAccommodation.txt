We'd also like you to note that rooms in the J.W. Marriott - the
official meeting hotel - are now becoming limited. We would recommend
booking your hotel room today to ensure you secure your place at the
centre of SMBE 2017.

You can book your room directly through our registration system, even
if you completed your registration at an earlier date. Just log back in
to the registration system to add accommodation to your booking.
Student accommodation is also available.
