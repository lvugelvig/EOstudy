Grant Writing Workshop at Mountain Lake Biological Station
July 24-29 2017

Mountain Lake Biological Station (MLBS) will offer a 6-day hands-on
grant writing workshop targeted at junior scientists who want to learn
strategies, styles, and structures to improve their grant proposals. The
experience is geared toward early career proposal writers including
graduate students, postdocs, and early stage faculty, and will include
direct discussions and writing sessions based on participants own
proposal ideas. The workshop will be led by former PI and current NSF
program officer Leslie Rissler.

The workshop will take place at MLBS, a residential field station atop
Salt Pond Mountain in the southern Appalachians. Cost for the workshop
is $250, plus room and board. Limited financial aid to defray room and
board costs is available. Space in the workshop will be limited to enable
close interaction. For more information, or to enroll, please email MLBS
Station Manager Jaime Jones (jjones@virginia.edu) or visit MLBS.org.
