ESEB 2017 SATELLITE WORKSHOP ON TUESDAY, 22 AUGUST

THE EUROPEAN DROSOPHILA POPULATION GENOMICS CONSORTIUM (DROSEU)

We would like to kindly invite you to participate in a satellite
discussion workshop on Drosophila population genomics and evolution,
held during the ESEB 2017 meeting in Groningen (16th Congress of the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology, 20-25 August 2017; Groningen;
http://www.eseb2017.nl).

The workshop will be held (contrary to our previous announcement) on
Tuesday 22 August between 15:00 and 17:00 in room J.

The workshop is open to all interested ESEB participants/evolutionary
biologists.

The main aim of the workshop is to present the work and the objectives of
the European Drosophila Population Genomics Consortium (DrosEU), funded
by an ESEB Special Topics Network (STN) grant, to the ESEB/evolutionary
biology community and to discuss future developments in the field of
Drosophila adaptation genomics.

The DrosEU consortium, founded in 2013, consists of approx. 70 scientists
from Europe and beyond: over the past few years, we have been sampling and
sequencing a large number of European Drosophila melanogaster populations
through space and time. The overarching goal of DrosEU is to foster
the integration and exchange of population genomic information and
data in the Drosophila system and to cooperate closely in collecting,
generating and analyzing genomic and environmental data for numerous
Drosophila populations across Europe and beyond in order to gain a better
understanding of adaptation. DrosEU is also closely collaborating with
the US-based Drosophila Real Time Evolution Consortium (Dros-RTEC)
(http://web.sas.upenn.edu/paul-schmidt-lab/dros-rtec).

We are looking forward to seeing you in Groningen.

Best wishes,
Josefa González (Barcelona), Martin Kapun (Lausanne), and Thomas Flatt
(Fribourg) on behalf of DrosEU
