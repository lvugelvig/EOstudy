Workshop Overview:
The Workshop on Genomics consists of a series of lectures, demonstrations
and computer laboratories that cover various aspects of genomics focusing
primarily on the analysis of modern sequencing data. Faculty are chosen
exclusively for their effectiveness in teaching theory and practice. The
course is designed for established investigators, postdoctoral scholars,
and advanced graduate students. Scientists with strong interests in
the uses of modern sequence data, analytical methods, and the use of
modern sequence data to study non-model organisms, variant detection and
analysis, genome visualization tools and related areas are encouraged
to apply for admission. Lectures and computer laboratories total ~90
hours of scheduled instruction. No programming experience is required.

Topics to be covered include:
- Sequencing technologies
- Genomics study design
- Manipulation of sequence data using the command-line
- Sequence data quality assessment and control
- Analyzing genomic data in the "cloud"
- Assembly and alignment: basic analyses used for de novo and re-
  sequencing studies
- The use of modern sequence data to study non-model organisms
- RNA-seq (using model and non-model organisms)
- RAD (Restriction site Associated DNA) sequence analysis
- Microbiome sequencing analysis
- Evolutionary genomics
- More!
