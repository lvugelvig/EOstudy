What is TREE?

The Three Rivers Evolution Event (TREE) is a conference sponsored by SMBE
and ASN that aims to bring together researchers from Western Pennsylvania
and the surrounding areas to share and discuss research in all aspects of
evolutionary biology. The research of attending members is expected to span
viruses, microbes, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, and include
ecology, anthropology, epidemiology, developmental biology, zoology,
theoretical, applied, urban ecology, paleontology, and many other
specialized research areas. Researchers of all stages, institutional
affiliations, and related fields (including ecologists, anthropologists,
paleontologists, and similar fields) are welcome to present. We are excited
at the diversity of current registrants, which as of this writing includes
104 scientists from 33 institutions, and 71 submitted abstracts!

When and Where: Saturday, September 9th, 2017 at the University of
Pittsburgh.
