Workshop Overview:
The Workshop on Population and Speciation Genomics brings together an
international collection of faculty members and Workshop participants
to study and discuss current ideas and techniques for the analysis of
genomic data on the level of populations and closely related species. The
Workshop consists of a series of lectures, demonstrations and computer
laboratories that cover various aspects of genomics focusing primarily on
the analysis of modern sequencing data. Faculty are chosen exclusively
for their effectiveness in teaching theory and practice. The course
is designed for established investigators, postdoctoral scholars,
and advanced graduate students. Scientists with strong interests in
the uses of modern sequence data, analytical methods, and the use of
modern sequence data to study populations of closely related species are
encouraged to apply for admission. Lectures and computer laboratories
total ~90 hours of scheduled instruction. No programming experience
is required.

Topics to be covered include:
- Introductions to UNIX, R, and Python
- Analyzing genomic data in the "cloud"
- Genomics data handling and file formats
- RAD (Restriction site Associated DNA) data analysis
- Analysis of low-coverage resequencing data
- Variant detection
- Likelihood and Bayesian inference
- Coalescent analyses of population structure and demography
- Analysis of adaptation and natural selection
- Selective sweep analyses
- Detection of introgression and admixture
- More!
