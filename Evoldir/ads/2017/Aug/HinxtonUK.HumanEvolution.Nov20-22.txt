Name:      Human Evolution: Fossils, Ancient and Modern Genomes conference
Dates:       20-22 November 2017
Location:  Wellcome Genome Campus Conference Centre, Hinxton, CB10 1RQ, UK
Website:  https://coursesandconferences.wellcomegenomecampus.org/events/item.aspx?e=651

This new conference will celebrate the maturity of the ancient
DNA field. The meeting will bring together genomic specialists,
palaeontologists, archaeologists, primatologists, medical geneticists
and other researchers interested in human evolution.

We will explore the use of genomic tools and large-scale analysis of
ancient nuclear DNA to deciphering population mixing, complex migration
patterns, microbiome evolution and the role of adaptive introgression
in human evolution.

Best wishes
