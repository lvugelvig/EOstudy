Dear colleagues,

We are delighted to announce the V Latin American Symposium of
Polychaeta (V SILPOLY), to be held on the campus of the University of
Costa Rica (UCR), San Jose Costa Rica, during July 17-19, 2018.

Both the Center of Marine Research in Marine Sciences and Limnology
(CIMAR) and the Museum of Zoology at UCR would like to invite students
and professionals studying annelid polychaetes to present their
exciting research to our community. The V SILPOLY will highlight the
research being made in Latin America and it is inclusive to all of
those interested in annelid biology.

Previously held in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico, V SILPOLY
will be the first SILPOLY to be held in Central America. We invite
people from all of the Americas and the rest of the world to
participate.

Research themes will include, but will not be limited to, evolution,
taxonomy and systematics, paleontology, ecology, diversity, genetics,
reproduction and development of polychaetes. We also open our door to
researchers studying sipunculans, echiurans, oligochaetes and leeches.
