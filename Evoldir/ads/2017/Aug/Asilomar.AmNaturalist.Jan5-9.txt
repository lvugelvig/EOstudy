Come celebrate 150 years of The American Naturalist!

The American Society of Naturalists is celebrating the 150th anniversary 
of the founding of The American Naturalist with a conference at the 
Asilomar Conference Center on the Pacific coast on 5-9 January 2018. 
Please visit http://amnat150.org.

Registration will open on Tuesday, 1 August 2017.  Because of the venue 
size, we can only accept 200 registrants for the conference, so don't 
delay.  Submission of titles and abstracts for talks and posters must be 
made at the time of registration, so please have that information ready 
when you go to the registration webpage.

The American Society of Naturalists strives to advance knowledge of 
unifying biological principles by uncovering processes that generate and 
maintain patterns of biological diversity. These patterns and processes 
necessarily involve complex interactions between ecology, evolution, 
genetics, behavior, and physiology. Consequently, ASN emphasizes the 
value of interdisciplinary research and collaborations between diverse 
biologists to achieve conceptual unification across the biological sciences.
This meeting will bring together a diverse array of biologists who might 
not normally encounter one another at separate discipline-specific meetings.

Come celebrate 150 years of The American Naturalist with us!
