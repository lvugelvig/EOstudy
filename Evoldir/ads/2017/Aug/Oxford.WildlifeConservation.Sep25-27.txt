First Annual Wildlife Trade Symposium: Evolving perspectives on demand
for illegal wildlife products

This three-day event is being organised by the Oxford Martin Programme
on the Illegal Wildlife Trade and co-hosted with generous support from
San Diego Zoo Global and TRAFFIC. The first day of the Symposium,
September 25th will set the scene for subsequent days, showcasing a
series of invited presentations, panel discussions and an open poster
session themed on:

Diverse approaches to illegal wildlife trade research

Linking the supply and demand for wildlife products

Changing wildlife consumption onto a legal, sustainable path

September 26th & 27th will consist of in-depth interactive sessions
covering a range of methodological and conceptual challenges of the
illegal wildlife trade more broadly. Delegates will have the
opportunity to select and register in advance for sessions in which
they wish to participate, customising their schedule for both days.
Sessions will be confirmed closer to the date and sign-up will be on a
first-come first-served basis.

September 26th will feature an evening debate on the Illegal Wildlife
Trade chaired by BBC journalist John Simpson.
