Course on "Reproducible data science for population genetics" (RDPG01)

This course will be delivered by Dr. Thibaut Jombart who authors 
theadegenet package and Dr. Zhian Kamvar.

www.prstatistics.com/course/reproducible-data-science-for-population-genetics-rdpg01/

This course will run from the 23rd - 27th October at Margam discovery 
centre in Wales, United Kingdom.

Course Overview:
With the increasing availability of various types of genetic and genomic 
data, population genetics and molecular ecology are becoming largely 
data driven sciences. Understanding the evolutionary, demographic, and 
ecological underpinning the genetic makeup of natural populations now 
relies on a combination of exploratory approaches and models. This 
course will provide an in-depth introduction to these techniques, with a 
strong emphasis on reproducibility though the use of modern analytic 
practices and tools. After an introduction to phylogenetic 
reconstruction, the course will cover a number of multivariate 
approaches for the analysis of genetic patterns, including supervised 
and unsupervised factorial methods, clustering approaches, and advanced 
methods for describing population diversity and revealing spatial 
genetic patterns. The approaches introduced will be applicable to most 
genetic data, including markers such as microsatellites, SNPs, or AFLP, 
as well as nucleotide and amino-acid sequence data. Every day will start 
with a lecture dedicated to a type of problem and methods, followed by 
an introduction to a specific technique for reproducible data analysis; 
afternoon will be devoted to hands on praticals. The last day will be 
devoted to open problems, where participants will be able to analyse 
their own data.

Monday 23rd - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00
Intro to phylogenetic reconstruction
Module 1a: reconstructing phylogenies from genetic sequence data. Three 
main approaches covered: distance-based phylogenies; maximum parsimony; 
and likelihood-based approaches.

Module 2a: key concepts in multivariate analysis. Focus on using 
factorial methods for genetic data analysis.
Module 2b: using R to generate high-quality pdf or word documents.
Practical 2: multivariate analysis of genetic data in R. Topics include: 
data handling, Hardy-Weinberg tests, measures of diversity, tests of 
population structure, principal component analysis (PCA), 
multidimensional scaling (MDS).
Main packages: knitr, rmarkdown, adegenet, ade4, pegasa, hierfstat, ape.

Wednesday 25th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00
Exploring group diversity
Module 3a: approaches for identifying and describing genetic clusters. 
Topics include: hierarchical clustering, K-means, genetic distances 
between populations, supervised factorial methods including 
between-group PCA and the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components 
(DAPC).
Module 3b: using R to generate beamer and html5 slides.
Practical 3: applying the approaches covered in morning lecture and 
emphasising their strengths and weaknesses.
Main packages: rmarkdown, adegenet, ade4, hierfstat.

Thursday 26th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00
Spatial genetic structures
Module 4a: on the origins of spatial genetic patterns, how to test for 
them, and how to reveal and visualise them.
Module 4b: asking questions the right way with reproducible code.
Practical 4: visualising and analysing spatial genetic data. Topics: 
spatial density estimates, univariate and multivariate tests of spatial 
structure (Moran and Mantel tests), mapping principal components from 
unsupervised methods (PCA), spatial PCA.
Main packages: reprex, adegenet, spdep, ade4.

Friday 27th - Classes from 09:00 to 16:00
Reproducible data science for population genetics in practice Open 
problem day - analyse your own data using R
Main packages: knitr, rmarkdown, adegenet, ade4, ape, pegas, phangorn, 
hierfstat, poppr, ggplot2, etc.
