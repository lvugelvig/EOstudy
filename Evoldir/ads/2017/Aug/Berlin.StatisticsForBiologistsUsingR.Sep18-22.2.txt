Dear all,

we have the last few spots available for the course
"STATISTICS FOR BIOLOGISTS USING R" in Berlin (Germany):
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course13/

Dates: 18-22 September 2017

Instructor: Dr. Ken Aho. Dr. Aho is an associate professor at Idaho
State University (USA) and author of the book "Foundational and Applied
Statistics for Biologists Using R."

Registration deadline: August 18th , 2017. Attendees are seated on a
first-come, first-served basis.

Course overview: This course will demonstrate the extensive capabilities
of the R environment, and seek to develop/broaden the competency of
participants in the use of R statistical applications.  The course will
have two components presented in morning and afternoon sessions over
five days.  Component one (Monday Sept. 18, Tuesday Sept. 19)  will
emphasize R programming characteristics including data management,
use of existing package functions, graphics, customized function
writing, calling routines from compiled languages, and documentation.
The second component (Wednesday Sept. 20 - Friday Sept. 22) will address
implementation of statistical analyses with R, particularly linear models.
The materials will be presented using biological examples, making frequent
use of the library asbio (Applied Statistics and Statistical Pedagogy
for Biologists).

Intended audience: This course is aimed at scientists, particularly
biologists.  While no previous experience with R is required, participants
should have at least a basic familiarity with statistical terms and
concepts.
