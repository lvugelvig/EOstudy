Geometric Morphometrics Using R (GMMR01)

https://www.prstatistics.com/course/geometric-morphometrics-using-r-gmmr01/

This course is being delivered by Prof. Dean Adams, Prof. Michael 
Collyer and Dr. Antigoni Kaliontzopoulou
 
This course will run from 19th - 23rd February 2018 at Margam 
Discovery Centre, Wales, UK.
 
The field of geometric morphometrics (GM) is concerned with the 
quantification and analysis of patterns of shape variation, and its 
covariation with other variables. Over the past several decades these 
approaches have become a mainstay in the field of ecology, evolutionary 
biology, and anthropology, and a panoply of analytical tools for 
addressing specific biological hypotheses concerning shape have been 
developed. The goal of this is to provide participants with a working 
knowledge of the theory of geometric morphometrics, as well as practical 
training in the application of these methods.
 
The course is organized in both theoretical and practical sessions. The 
theoretical sessions will provide a comprehensive introduction to the 
methods of landmark-based geometric morphometrics, which aims at 
providing the participants with a solid theoretical background for 
understanding the procedures used in shape data analysis. Practical 
sessions will include worked examples, giving the participants the 
opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the treatment of shape data 
using the R package geomorph. These sessions focus on the generation of 
shape variables from primary landmark data, the statistical treatment of 
shape variation with respect to biological hypotheses, and the 
visualization of patterns of shape variation and of the shapes 
themselves for interpretation of statistical findings, using the R 
language for statistical programming. While practice datasets will be 
available, it is strongly recommended that participants come with their 
own datasets.
 
Note: Because this is a geometric morphometrics workshop in R, it is 
required that participants have some working knowledge in R. The 
practical sessions of the course will focus on GM-based analyses, and 
not basic R user-interfacing. It is therefore strongly recommended that 
participants refresh their R skills prior to attending the workshop.
