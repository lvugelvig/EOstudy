Course description

This course will provide an introduction to next generation sequencing
(NGS) platforms, data analysis and tools for data quality control,
read alignment (mapping) and differential expression. The course will
be delivered using a mixture of lectures and computer based hands on
practical sessions using real data.

This course is aimed at wet-lab biologists who are involved in research
projects that will require the handling and analysis of NGS data. A
significant proportion of the course will be computer-based using command
line tools in the Unix environment, therefore, in order to gain maximum
benefit from the course all attendees should have basic Unix skills.
