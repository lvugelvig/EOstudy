"Landscape genomics/genetics using R"

Delivered by Prof. Rodney Dyer a leading expert in landscape genetics.

http://www.prstatistics.com/course/landscape-genetic-data-analysis-using-r-
lndg02/

This course will run from 6th - 10th November 2016 at Margam Discovery
Centre, Wales.

The term 'landscape genetics' has been applied studies that 
integrate
ecological context and intervening landscape into population genetic
analyses of contemporary processes such as gene flow and migration.  
This
course will cover the basics of both quantitative landscape ecology and
population genetics, focusing on how we develop and evaluate
spatial/genetic analyses using the R platform

Course content is as follows
Day 1
-	Spatial & Ecological Data
-	Installation & configuring R & RStudio
-	Acquiring spatial data, projections, and visualization
-	Vector and raster data

Day 2
-	Genetic markers and basic analyses
-	Genetic markers and sampling
-	Genetic distance, diversity, and structure
-	Ordination techniques based upon genetic markers

Day 3
-	Integrating spatial and genetic data
-	Barrier detection & population division
-	Resistance Modeling
-	Mantel and distance regressions
-	Remote sensing - LiDAR and Hyperspectral data

Day 4
-	Integrating spatial and genetic data
-	Spatial autocorrelation
-	Network Approaches
-	PCMN & Redundancy

Day 5
-	Adaptive Genetic Variance
-	Outliers & gradients
-	Quantitative genetics, why we should care.
-	Chromosome walking
