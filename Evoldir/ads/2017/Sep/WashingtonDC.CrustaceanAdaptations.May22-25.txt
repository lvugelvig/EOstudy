Dear Colleagues,

We would like to announce a special session on "Adaptations to Life
in the Deep Sea and Caves" to be held during the 9th International
Crustacean Congress (ICC9) in Washington, D.C. from May 22-25, 2018.
Through this session we aim to bring together a diverse set of researchers
studying common evolutionary themes in extreme environments such as
deep sea, polar regions, and caves.  Talks on adaptations related to the
"Darkness Syndrome" (Danielopol et al., 1996) or any other aspects of
life in these extreme environments are welcome, including physiological,
morphological, neurological, behavioral and ecological mechanisms related
to crustacean survival.

For more information regarding the conference,
please check the conference website at

Abstract submissions are due 1 March 2018.  If you have any questions
about the session, please feel free to contact any of the session
organizers.
