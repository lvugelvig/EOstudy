AGA2018, the AGA President's Symposium, will take place next July in the
beautiful rolling hills of Waimea, Hawai'i.  The meeting will open with a
pupu reception on July 22, encompass 2 days of invited talks and poster
sessions, and end with a luau banquet featuring local entertainment.  A
half-day applied workshop will follow on July 25.

AGA symposia are small, friendly gatherings, and provide wonderful
opportunities for researchers and students to engage with one another and
share their science.  The 2018 meeting will focus on processes at the early
stages of adaptive radiation, such as admixture, priority effects, and
repeated evolution. Invited speakers confirmed thus far include:

*  The AGA Key Distinguished Lecturer:  Ole Seehausen, EAWAG (The Swiss
Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology )
*  Jonathan Losos, Harvard
*  Kerry Shaw, Cornell
*  Christine Parent, Univ of Idaho
*  Jim Mallett, Harvard
*  Scott Hodges, UC Santa Barbara

The AGA keeps registration costs low to encourage participation.  Awards
will be available to help support students.
