Dear colleagues,

There will be an "Avian Genomics" workshop at the international PAG
conference in January in San Diego http://www.intlpag.org/. I will host
it for the 3rd time: "Avian Genomics - Gone Wild!". PAG 2018 will be
from Jan 13th to Jan 17th.

To get an overview of the last session of 2017 here is the link:

And this was the first edition in 2016:

If your work falls within the area of avian genomics, especially of
birds in the wild, please send your abstract (200-300 words, no special
format) to me by October 15th. Do not hesitate to ask any questions.

Best wishes,
Robert
