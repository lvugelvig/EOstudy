Course description

This workshop serves as a standalone introduction to DNA-seq as well as
the first of a two-part course in conjunction with our Exome Variants,
Copy Number Calling, Variant Annotation and Reporting Workshop in
December. The course will be delivered using a mixture of lectures and
computer based hands on practical sessions using real data.

This course is aimed at clinicians and wet-lab biologists who are
involved in research projects that will require the handling and
analysis of DNA-seq data. A significant proportion of the course will
be computer-based using command line tools in the Unix environment and
applicants will find it useful to have a grasp of basic skills such as
file navigation and management, though an introduction to the command
line interface will be provided.
