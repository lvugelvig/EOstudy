Dear all,

It is time to start thinking about the next *Camelid workshop* at the Plant
and Animal Genomic conference PAGXXVI 2018 <http://www.intlpag.org/2018/>,
Jan 13-17, San Diego.

Therefore, we would like to invite everyone interested in camelid
genetics/genomics to *send your abstracts* to the workshop organizers Pamela
Burger <pamela.burger@vetmeduni.ac.at> and Don Miller <dm96@cornell.edu>*
by October 6th* 2017 or earlier. This gives us time to *select abstracts
for oral presentatio*n at the workshop while the remaining will be posters.

*If you have been invited to be a Workshop Speaker,* you will receive an
email with instructions regarding submission of your workshop abstract.
This email will include a personalized link to submit and edit your
abstract.
All *poster abstracts* will need to be submitted to the PAGXXVI
<https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/cfp.cgi> electronic system*.*

Looking forward for exciting contributions.

With best wishes,

Pamela Burger (chair) and Don Miller (co-chair)
