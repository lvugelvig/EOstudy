Course: Geometric Morphometrics

5-9 March 2018, Berlin
(Germany):https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course22/

Instructor:

Dr. Carmelo Fruciano (Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane,
Australia))

Topic

Introductory and intermediate Geometric Morphometrics.

Overview

Geometric Morphometrics has become a standard in biological research
because it combines statistical rigour and ease of interpretation. Through
geometric morphometrics, biological form is quantified, analysed and the
results are expressed as easily interpretable and visually impactful
shape changes. This course covers the main common practices of modern
geometric morphometrics, including: acquiring data, analysing it,
visualizing and interpreting the results.

Course Format

The course will be delivered over five days and will comprise both
lectures and hands-on sessions. The lectures will cover both basic
theoretical aspects and their practical implementation in research
practice and software. During the hands-on sessions, the attendees will
have the chance of both using example datasets and applying the knowledge
acquired to their own data. The course will be focused mainly on 2D data
and on easy-to-use software with graphical user interface to maximize the
ability to understand concepts and apply them. However, some information
on 3D data and on R implementations will be provided, as appropriate.

Who Should Attend

This course is aimed at beginners and intermediate users. In other words,
it is aimed at researchers who intend to use geometric morphometrics
or who have started performing geometric morphometric analyses but feel
they need a more structured background.

Requirements

Attendees should have a background in biology and a basic understanding
of statistical concepts.
