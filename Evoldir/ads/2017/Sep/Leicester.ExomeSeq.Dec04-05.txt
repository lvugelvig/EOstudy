Course description

This workshop is the second in a two-part course in conjunction with our
Introduction to DNA-seq workshop in November. While attendance at the
November workshop is not a pre-requisite, this workshop will requires
experience with the topics covered therein (see link below). The course
provides an introduction to calling variants and copy number alterations
from exome sequencing data alignments, variant annotation, variant effect
prediction and reporting recommendations. The course will be delivered
using a mixture of lectures and computer based hands on practical sessions
using real data.

This course is aimed at clinicians and wet-lab biologists who are involved
in research projects that will require the handling and analysis of
DNA-seq, exome data and sequence variation. A significant proportion of
the course will be computer-based using command line tools in the Unix
environment and applicants will require a grasp of basic skills such as
file navigation and management.
