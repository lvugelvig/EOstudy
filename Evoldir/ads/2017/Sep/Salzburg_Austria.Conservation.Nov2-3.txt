The conference will cover topical research and concepts e.g. on
wilderness, biodiversity, species protection, ecology and the function of
running waters, the effects of climate change and the role of long-term
monitoring. In addition, issues of applied conservation research,
protected area management and sustainable development will be debated.

The symposium provides a perfect opportunity for encounters across
disciplinary and protected area boundaries, where participants can
share and exchange views and findings and intensify the dialogue between
researchers and practitioners.

Fringe events include a public talk on Thursday evening on "Whatsalp
Vienna - Nice 2017. A trip by foot through the Alps and their large
protected areas" and the "Nationalparks Austria Science Award 2017"
gala on Friday evening.

We look forward to welcoming you in Salzburg!

We apologize for any cross-postings and associated inconveniences.

Kind regards,

Dipl.-Ing. Wolfgang Urban, MBA Director, Hohe Tauern National Park,
