The 7th meeting of the Italian Society for Evolutionary Biology will be
held in Rome, Italy on August 28-31 2017
(http://sibe2017.uniroma2.it) 
The congress will be structured in seven sequential symposia. Their
subjects were selected accounting for the existing broad spectrum of
interests and approaches to the study of Evolution. Here they
are: 
Advanced models and technologies for the study of Evolution 
Biogeography and Systematics 
Evo-Devo 
Evolution and Conservation 
Co-Evolution and Symbiosis 
Evolutionary and Behavioural Ecology 
The effects of drift and selection on populations and genomes:
expectations and observations 
We also foresee a poster session and a round table, this last focused on
a theme at present very important: Popularization of Evolution. 
We hope that you will join us for the SIBE 2017 congress and look forward
to seeing you in Rome this coming August.
