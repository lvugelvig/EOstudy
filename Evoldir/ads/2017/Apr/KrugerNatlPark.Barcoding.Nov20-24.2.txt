Kruger National Park

**FINAL CALL FOR ABSTRACTS**

The African Centre for DNA Barcoding (ACDB), the University of
Johannesburg (UJ), International Barcode of Life Project (iBOL), and the
Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) are proud to announce and
welcome delegates to our hosting of the 7th International Barcode of
Life Conference, 20 - 24 November 2017. This is the first time that this
event will be held on the African continent. The venue for the hosting
of this prestigious event will be the Nombolo Mdhluli Conference Centre,
Skukuza.

The major theme of the conference is exploring mega-diverse biotas with
DNA barcodes. A series of presentations and workshops will focus on the
use of DNA to understand diversity patterns and ecological processes in
species-rich and complicated ecosystems. The conference also provides a
general forum for presentations, posters, and discussion on the wider
field of DNA barcoding.

Delegates are encouraged to register as soon as possible as space is
limited.

Abstracts should be submitted at www.abstracts.dnabarcodes2017.org 
<http://www.abstracts.dnabarcodes2017.org/>

before or on 28th April 2017.
