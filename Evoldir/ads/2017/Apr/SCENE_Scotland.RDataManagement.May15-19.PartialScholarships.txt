'ALL INCLUSIVE PLACES' AVAILABLE AT 490.00 (Fees have been 
subsidised by 35% from 755.00).

Applications should be sent to oliverhooker@prstatistics.com and contain
the following.

5.	150 words why this course would be relevant to your research or how 
it would help.

Application deadline is Tuesday 17th April 2017

We still have 'normal' places available for anyone else interested.

Full course details are given below

http://www.prstatistics.com/course/coding-data-management-and-shiny-applications-using-rstudio-for-evolutionary-biologists-and-ecologists-cdsr01/

This course will run from 15th - 19th May at SCENE field station, 
Scotland.

The course will introduce programming logic using the R syntax. The 
participants will be able to solve problems involving heterogeneous 
biological datasets and the combined use of different statistical 
packages, so the advantages of learning programming skills can be 
demonstrated. The RMarkdown syntax will be used to illustrate the 
advantages of literate programming and the possibilities of code sharing 
and archiving. In the sequence, participants will learn how to design 
relational databases (RDB) which can be used to manage and analyse large 
biological datasets. They will learn the basics of the SQL language and 
how to use it with R with the package {RMySQL}.

To finalise, they will use the Shiny tool (R Studio) to build 
interactive applications to analyse and display data depending on user 
inputs. Throughout the course we will emphasise data, code and analyses 
best practices that could foster reproducibility and transparency in 
science, and the long-term availability of scientific data. At the end 
of the course the participants are expected to be able to develop small, 
tailored applications, to read and analyse datasets using a variety of 
statistics tools.

Monday 15th
Module 1: Programming Logic
R syntax (Variable types - operators - conditionals - loops - 
writing functions)
Programming and commenting code with RMarkdown

Tuesday 16th
Module 2: Data structures
R syntax (arrays, lists, data frames, matrices)
Data wrangling with {dplyr} and {tidyr}; the {ff} package and data 
tables for large datasets (e.g. transcriptomics; whole-genome data)
Best practices of data acquisition, organization and storage

Wednesday 17th
Module 3: Relational databases
Introduction to the SQL language and MySQL (open-source RDB freeware)
Accessing and analysing large datasets using the package {RMySQL}
As an example, we will combine DNA sequence datasets with IUCN Red List 
data illustrate the use of RDB to biological datasets.

Thursday 18th
Module 4: Introduction to Shiny (R Studio)
Shiny - Server and user interface commands
As an example we will use Shiny to develop a small application where 
users can select different species and genes and run/visualize 
phylogenetic trees using {ape} running in the background.

Friday 19th
Module 5: Wrapping-up
Development and presentation of individual projects combining data 
wrangling skills and user inputs using Shiny (R Studio)

Please feel free to distribute this material anywhere you feel is 
suitable.
