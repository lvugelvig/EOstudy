Dear colleagues,

Registration is open for the course "THE USE OF PHYLOGENIES IN THE STUDY
OF MACROEVOLUTION - 5th edition".

Dates: October 16th-20th, 2017.

Instructor: Dr. Juan López Cantalapiedra (Museum für Naturkunde,
Germany).

This course is aimed at postgraduate students, postdoctoral researchers
and established academics.

The course will introduce the use of phylogenetic information to
reconstruct ancestral characters and biogeographic histories, using
different phylogenetic comparative methods. It will also tackle trait
evolution modeling and the assessment of phylogenetic signal. Finally,
we will learn about the shape of phylogenetic trees and its evolutionary
causes, and how to estimate the rates of diversification throughout the
history of groups.

The course includes an optional first introductory day to basic R.

Important note: Please bear in mind that this course is not about
reconstructing (building) phylogenetic trees.

Software: Mesquite, FigTree, R (ape, TreeSim, TreePar, Geiger, OUwie,
BioGeoBEARS).

Participants are encouraged to bring their data sets to use in the
practical class.

Place: Facilities of the CRIP at Els Hostalets de Pierola, Barcelona
(Spain).

Organized by: Transmitting Science, the Centre de Restauració i
Interpretació Paleontologica and the Institut Catalá de Paleontologia
Miquel Crusafont.

Please feel free to distribute this information between your colleagues
if you consider it appropriate.
