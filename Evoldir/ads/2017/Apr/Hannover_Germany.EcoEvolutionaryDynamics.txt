Dear colleagues,

The DFG Priority Program DynaTrait: Flexibility matters: Interplay between 
trait diversity and ecological dynamics using aquatic communities as model 
systems
funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) hosts an international 
conference on eco-evolutionary trait dynamics in aquatic systems from Oct 
09-13, 2017 in Hannover, Germany.

The conference registration is now open:
http://www.dynatrait.de/dynatrait/dynatrait-conference-2017/conference-registration.html

There are still free spaces for presentations and posters, as well as 
limited funds available for travelling support.
Please circulate this information widely to researchers who might be 
interested in joining the conference. You may contact me directly at 
aboit@uni-potsdam.de, if you have any questions. Thank you!

Best wishes,
Alice Boit (scientific coordinator)
