Dear colleague,

in our Göttingen SPIRIT summer school "Molecular Genetics for
Zoologists" (August 14th to 18th 2017) we want to discuss functional
genetic approaches in emerging model organisms and we offer hands on
training for PhD students and postdocs in RNA-seq, CRISPR/Cas9; RNAi;
in situ hybridization etc. (See details below).

Please forward this mail to young scientists that might be interested
and put up the attached * poster.

Thanks and we hope to see you in Göttingen!

Gregor Bucher, Nico Posnien, Daniel Jackson, Ernst Wimmer

Part 1: Göttingen Symposium on Molecular Zoology

In this 2-day symposium, we want to bring together international
scientists working on understanding the function of genes underlying
all kinds of zoological phenomena.

Invited speakers:

Sue Brown (Kansas State University)

Taro Nakamura (Harvard University)

Michalis Averof (IGFL, Lyon)

Guy Smagghe (Ghent University, Gent)

Frank Lyko (DKFZ, Heidelberg)

Ralf Nauen (BAYER Crop Science, Monheim)

Antje Burse (MPI for Chemical Ecology, Jena)

Irina Häcker (Fraunhofer IME, Gießen)

Part 2: Göttingen SPIRIT Summer school "Molecular Genetics for
Zoologists"

Following the symposium, we offer a 3-day hands on training on these
methods and we will discuss their application to the particular projects
of the participants. We hope, that you will leave Göttingen with an
enhanced working plan for your project. This part is restricted to 20
PhD students or postdocs.

Application and Registration:

Please register until June 16th according to the details given on our
website.
