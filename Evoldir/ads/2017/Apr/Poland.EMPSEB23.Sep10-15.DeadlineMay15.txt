EMPSEB provides a platform for PhD students studying Evolutionary
Biology to present their work and to meet their peers from across
Europe.  Joining the participants are 8-10 senior scientists who are
invited to give plenary talks, run discussion groups, and to provide
guidance about starting your scientific career. The meeting provides
the unique opportunity for students to hear the latest research being
conducted in Europe, meet future international collaborators, and to
present their own work to peers.
