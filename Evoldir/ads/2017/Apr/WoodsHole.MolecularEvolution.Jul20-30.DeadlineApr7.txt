APPLICATION WINDOW CLOSING SOON:  April 7, 2017

The Workshop on Molecular Evolution will be held July 20-30, 2017.
It is the premier program for integrating the methods, theory,
and applications of molecular phylogenetics, statistical genetics,
molecular evolution, and related disciplines.  

As the course progresses, participants learn how to use the following
software to address questions concerning the origins, maintenance,
and function of molecular variation: ASTRAL, BEAST2, BEST, BPP, FASTA,
FigTree, GARLI, MIGRATE, MAFFT, MP-EST, RaxML, RevBayes, PAML, PAUP*,
Phybase, ipyrad and SVD Quartets. Students will have the opportunity to
work with software on their own laptops as well as receive training on
how to use the same programs on a high performance computer cluster.

Course instructors include Peter Beerli, Joseph Bielawski, Belinda Chang,
Mario dos Reis, Casey Dunn, Deren Eaton, Scott Edwards, Tracy Heath,
