4th ANdinA international workshop
Species range extensions and local adaptation:
Challenging ecological and evolutionary ideas and assumptions
San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, 29 January-2 February 2018

ANdinA holds its unique dialogue-style workshops in wonderful
locations around the world every two years.  We bring together 30-40
researchers from a diverse range of disciplines to discuss challenges,
contentious issues, new ideas and future directions in topics related
to ecology, evolution and management.  We then publish the results of
our deliberations. This time we will be in the mountains of Patagonia
discussing two distinct but inter-dependent topics: species range
extensions and local adaptation.  We are seeking expressions of interest
from enthusiastic evolutionary biologists who are prepared to actively
involve themselves in relaxed, free-flowing interdisciplinary dialogue.
The deadline for applications is 1 June 2017.

The cost for everything (except travel to Patagonia and alcoholic
beverages) is just US$1000.  One third of places are reserved for
Early-Career Researchers (who pay only US$400). Everyone will have the
opportunity to co-author at least one discussion paper to be submitted to
an international journal. For further details and instructions, please
