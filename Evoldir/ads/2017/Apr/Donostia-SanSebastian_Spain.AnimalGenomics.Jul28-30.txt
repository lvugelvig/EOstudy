Molecular approaches, methods and techniques in animal ecology
Donostia-San Sebastian, The Basque Country
July 28-30
More information and registration: http://www.ebrs2017.eus/molecularecologycourse

This is a 3-day (24 hours) intensive cutting-edge introduction to
molecular methods and techniques applied to animal ecology. The course
aims to provide students with the necessary theoretical and technical
ground to choose appropriate approaches and to develop correct
experimental designs when conceiving molecular studies of wildlife
ecology.

MODULE 1 - INTRODUCTION TO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Introduction and overview of the course 
Historical overview of molecular techniques applied to ecological research
General concepts and techniques
High-throughput sequencing/Next generation sequencing platforms
Targeted sequencing, reduced representation genome sequencing and whole genome sequencing
Key aspects for a good experimental design

MODULE 2 - GENERAL TECHNIQUES IN MOLECULAR ECOLOGY 
Sample collection and storage
DNA extraction
PCR amplification
Library build
Sequencing
Bioinformatic pre-processing

MODULE 3 - POPULATION GENOMICS
Moving from population genetics to population genomics
Data management and summary statistics (PLINK)
Population structure and genetic differentiation
Identifying loci under selection - Fst outlier tests (population genomics approaches)
Identifying local adaptations - Gene-Environment Associations (landscape genomics approaches)
Practical population and landscape genomics (R)

MODULE 4 - DNA METABARCODING 
Introduction to environmental DNA and metabarcoding
Things to consider when planning a metabarcoding diet study - in the
lab, in the analyses and in the interpretation of results In the lab:
Quality check of DNA extracts and PCR reactions, tagging PCR products and
preparing amplicon pools for sequencing In the analyses: How to balance
error removal with detection of low abundance prey Interpretation of
results in a metabarcoding diet study

MODULE 5 - METAGENOMICS
Introduction to shotgun metagenomics applied to gut microbiota
In the lab: shotgun library build and sequencing
In the screen: dataset cleaning (clonality, low-complexity reads...),
read assembly and mapping strategies.  Taxonomic analyses: taxonomy
assignment and taxonomy diversity statistics Functional approach: gene
prediction, functional annotation and functional diversity statistics

MODULE 6 - ONE-BY-ONE SESSIONS 
15 minute sessions
Experimental design of own projects
Project specific technical questions
