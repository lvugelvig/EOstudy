Dates

23-27 October 2017

INSTRUCTOR

Dr Jing Hua Zhao (https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t20/)

Trained in medicine, medical statistics and statistical genetics, he
had worked on statistical and computational methods for epidemiological
and public health studies at several institutions until 2005, when he
joined the MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, to work on
design and analysis of GWAS such as the EPIC-Norfolk, the Fenland and
the InterAct. He has also participated in numerous genetic analysis
workshops which involve both simulated and real data such as those from
the Framingham heart study. Besides methodological development, data
analysis, and other academic activities, he has also had tutorials on
genetic dissection of complex traits with focus on GWAS at UseR! 2008,
2009, and 2010 Conferences and contributed a Henry-Stewart talk on
genetic association with R.

Workshop Overview

The past decade has witnessed an astonishing development and the universal
use of genome wide association studies (GWAS) in identification and
characterisation of genetic variants underlying disorders and other
variations in human and other species, which has an immense impact
in biomedical research. This is owing to the ability to efficiently
generate and process large quantity of genetic polymorphisms as well as to
integrate with other sources such as gene expression and methylation. To
tackle challenges in GWAS, a lot of methods and techniques have been
established but many others are still evolving. The workshop therefore
intends to give a grand picture as well as practical aspects of GWAS.

Targeted audience and assumed background

The purpose of this workshop is to render both a broad picture and
computational details of GWAS to biomedical researchers and related
fields. It sets to explore the biological, statistical, and computational
concepts, methodologies and practices involving a variety of software
based on Linux and R. Examples of consortium contributions will also
be given. These will be particularly beneficial to those who come with
their own problems and wish to implement the analysis.

Workshop structure

The workshop contains both lecture and computer sessions, designed
to help participants to understand the background, methodology and
implementation. The computer session is designed to facilitate data
analysis and interpretation.
