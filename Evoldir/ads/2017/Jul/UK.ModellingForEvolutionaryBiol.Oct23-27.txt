"Structural Equation Modelling for Ecologists and Evolutionary 
Biologists”

Delivered by Dr. Jarret Byrnes and Dr. Jon Lefcheck

www.prstatistics.com/course/structural-equation-modelling-for-ecologists-and-evolutionary-biologists-semr01/

This course will run from 23rd - 27th October 2017 at Margam Park
Discovery Centre, Wales, UK

Course only and all inclusive packages are available.

The course is a primer on structural equation modelling (SEM) and
confirmatory path analysis, with an emphasis on practical skills and
applications to real-world data.

Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is a rapidly growing technique in
ecology and evolution that unites multiple hypotheses in a single causal
network. It provides an intuitive graphical representation of 
relationships
among variables, underpinned by well-described mathematical estimation
procedures. Several advances in SEM over the past few years have 
expanded
its utility for typical ecological datasets, which include count data,
missing observations, and nested or hierarchical designs.
We will cover the basic philosophy behind SEM, provide approachable
mathematical explanations of the techniques, and cover recent extensions 
to
mixed effects models and non-normal distributions. Along the way, we 
will
work through many examples from the primary literature using the open-
source statistical software R (www.r-project.org). We will draw on two
popular R packages for conducting SEM, including lavaan and 
piecewiseSEM.
Participants are encouraged to bring their own data, as there will be
opportunities throughout the course to plan, analyse, and receive 
feedback
on structural equation models.
