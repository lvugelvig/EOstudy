Applied Statistics and Bioinformatics with R and Bioconductor

https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course19/

22-26 January 2018, Berlin (Germany)

Overview

This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical
statistical and data analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of
high-throughput biological data. The course assumes some familiarity
with genomics and with R programming, but does not assume prior
statistical training. It covers the statistical concepts necessary
to design experiments and analyze high-dimensional data generated
by high-throughput sequencing, including: exploratory data analysis,
principal components analysis, unsupervised clustering, batch effects,
linear modeling for differential expression, gene set analysis.
