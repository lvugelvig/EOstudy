*Workshop FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOINFORMATICS*
Organised by ELIXIR Belgium and the VIB Bioinformatics Core

Date: 14-15 September 2017
Location: Ghent, Belgium

*Goals*
This workshop will introduce the basic concepts of comparative and 
functional -omics data analysis in plants through lectures and practical 
hands-on sessions. Both plant biologists and geneticists with an 
interest in bioinformatics, data analysis, and comparative & regulatory 
genomics should attend this training.  After this workshop, you will 
have a good understanding of the organization and evolution of plant 
gene families and know how to extract relevant biological information 
from -omics gene sets.

*Summary*
DAY 1
Introduction plant comparative genomics (genes, gene families, synteny 
analysis) + introduction PLAZA platform
Functional characterization of plant genes (Families, GO, InterPro)

DAY 2
Gene set analysis for different plant -omics data sets:
- functional interpretation of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq genes using the 
PLAZA Workbench
- co-expression and Transcription Factor analysis

*Prerequisites*
basic knowledge of genes, genomes, transcript profiling, BLAST, 
homology, Gene Ontology (no programming skills are required).
