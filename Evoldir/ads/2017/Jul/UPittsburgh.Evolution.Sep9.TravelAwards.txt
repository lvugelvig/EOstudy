What is TREE?

The Three Rivers Evolution Event (TREE) aims to bring together researchers
from Western Pennsylvania and the surrounding areas to share and discuss
research in all aspects of evolutionary biology. The research of attending
members is expected to span viruses, microbes, plants, invertebrates and
vertebrates, and include ecology, anthropology, epidemiology, developmental
biology, zoology, theoretical, applied, urban ecology, paleontology, and
many other specialized research areas. Researchers of all stages,
institutional affiliations, and related fields (including ecologists,
anthropologists, paleontologists, and similar fields) are welcome to
present.
