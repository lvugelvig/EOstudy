COURSE DESCRIPTION:
The aim of the course is to provide a practical introduction to the
analysis of "omics" data. Topics will range from data
visualization/exploration to univariate/multivariate analysis and machine
learning. Practical exemples and applications will be illustrated by using
R and Python.

COURSE MILESTONES:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Univariate/Multivariate analysis
- Introduction to machine learning: classifiers, performance measures,
  diagnostics
- Machine learning tools for the analysis of Gene Expression data
- The Data Analysis Plan (DAP) - intro to unbiased pipelines for
  (binary) classification
- Performance measures and diagnostic plots - Accuracy, MCC, Stability:
  theory and graphics
- Differential network analysis - co-expression networks, graph
  comparison, community detection: theory and examples in
  R/Python, visualization by the igraph library and use of the
  ReNette web interface
- Basic application of ML to gene prediction
