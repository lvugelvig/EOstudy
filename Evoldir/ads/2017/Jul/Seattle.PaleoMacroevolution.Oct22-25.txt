Dear All,

We are convening a topical session entitled "Biodiversity dynamics
in the face of environmental change: Integrating paleontological and
neontological approaches to macroevolution" at the 2017 Geological
Society of America conference. The conference will be held 22-25 October
in Seattle, Washington. Our session (T51) will focus on how environmental
changes have shaped Earth's biodiversity through geologic time and
how these macroevolutionary relationships might be used to understand
the responses of extant species to current and projected environmental
conditions. Invited speakers include Samantha Price (University of
California, Davis), Andy Purvis (Natural History Museum London), and
Alejandro Ordonez (Queen's University).

If you have a current project that fits the scope of our
session we hope that you will consider submitting an abstract for
consideration. Abstract submission will be open around April 1st,
2017 and close on August 1. We are keenly interested in putting
together a slate of talks that span a diversity of disciplinary
approaches and including presenters from neontological backgrounds
who are interested in incorporating paleontological perspectives
into their research. For more information about the conference:

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us and if
you know others who might be interested please consider forwarding this
announcement to them.
