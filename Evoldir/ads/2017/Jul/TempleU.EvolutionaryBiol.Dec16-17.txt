We are pleased to announce the following molecular evolution meeting
hosted at Temple University (Philadelphia, PA, USA) this fall. With
support from BMC Evolutionary Biology, the meeting "Theory and Models
Meet Data in Evolutionary Biology and Genomics" is a free meeting that
will take place on Dec. 16-17, 2017. The first day of the meeting will
have a set of invited seminars, followed by a poster session on the
morning of the second day.

Registration is necessary (through the website, even if you are not
presenting a poster). Registration will enable you to upload a poster
title/abstract and enable us to gauge the number of participants.

Confirmed speakers to date include Arndt von Haeseler (Vienna), Corina
Tarnita (Princeton), Kateryna Makova (Penn State), Jody Hey (Temple),
and Blair Hedges (Temple). I hope to see you there. For more
information, see the website (which will be updated as additional
information becomes available): igem.temple.edu/bmceb/. Please join us.
