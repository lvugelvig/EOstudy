Dear all,

We are pleased to inform you that we will run two Python courses this
year in Berlin:

1. Introduction to Python for biologists. 2-6 October 2017

Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for biologists:
https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/)

This course is aimed at all researchers and technical workers with a
background in biology who want to learn programming. Students should have
enough biological background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know about DNA and protein sequences, what
translation is, and what introns and exons are). No previous programming
experience or computer skills (beyond the ability to use a text editor)
are necessary, but you'll need to have a laptop with Python installed.

Syllabus:

1. Advanced Python for biologists. 13-17 November 2017

Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for biologists:
https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/)

The advanced course is aimed at people who want to develop bigger or more
complicated programs in Python, or to learn more about the language,
or to explore different approaches (object-oriented, functional)
to programming. The material covered is very general purpose and
can be applied to any kind of problem. Students should have enough
biological/bioinformatics background to appreciate the examples and
exercise problems (i.e. they should know what a protein accession number,
BLAST report, and FASTA sequence is). They should also have basic Python
experience (the Introduction to Python for Biologists course will fulfil
these requirements). Students should be familiar with the use of lists,
loops, functions and conditions in Python and have written at least a
few small programs from scratch.
