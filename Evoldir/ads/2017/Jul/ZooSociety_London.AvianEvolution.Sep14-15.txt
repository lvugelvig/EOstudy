Do you study how birds are adapting to a rapidly changing world? We
would like to invite you to join us at Bird Sense 2017 where we will
discuss the flexibility and evolutionary potential of birds to respond
to shifts in their environments. We will explore how research on avian
sensory ecology is revealing how birds perceive the varying landscapes
in which they live, and how we might tackle challenges faced in welfare,
conservation and anthropogenic change.

Birds inhabit every continent of the world and virtually all available
ecological niches, from cities to the frozen tundra, from tropical
rainforests to deserts, and from mountain ranges to the ocean. They eat
fruits and insects; snails and worms; cereal grains and plants; mammals
and fish; beeswax; sap, and nectar. But in our human-modified world
birds face many challenges their ancestors did not: the glass fronts of
tall buildings, wind turbines and power lines, artificial daylight that
turns night to day; and noisy air traffic that moves faster than any of
their natural predators. But birds also cause conflicts for humans: they
can be major pests of crops and cause nuisance in urban settings. Some
birds are thriving; others are struggling.

Together, can we formulate questions, instruments and analyses to capture
how birds make sense of their changing word?
