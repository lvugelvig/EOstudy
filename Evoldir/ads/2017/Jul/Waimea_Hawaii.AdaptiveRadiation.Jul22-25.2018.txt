SAVE THE DATE FOR AGA2018!

We are now planning the next AGA President's Symposium, to be held at the
Hawaii Preparatory Academy in beautiful Waimea, Hawai'i.

AGA symposia focus on a single topic and last for 2-3 days.  They are
small, friendly gatherings, and provide wonderful opportunities for
researchers and students to engage with one another and share their
science.  The 2018 meeting will examine processes at the early stages of
adaptive radiation, focusing on phenomena such as admixture, priority
effects, and repeated evolution. Invited speakers will discuss their
research in such areas as

·      The role of allopatry vs sympatry in fostering initial divergence

·      Interplay between isolation and mixing in divergence and adaptation

·      The role of plasticity in facilitating adaptation

·      The role and extent of hybridization and admixture, and at what
stage they occur in the evolutionary process

·      Repeated evolution of similar forms

·      Conditions that facilitate adaptive radiation, and their relative
rates and extents.
Details will be available soon on the AGA website:  http://www.theaga.org

Best wishes,
