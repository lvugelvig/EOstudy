Workshop: Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data

https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course18/

Dates: 5th-9th February 2018

Instructors:

Dr. Vladimir Kiselev (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK)

Dr. Tallulah Andrews (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK)

COURSE OVERVIEW

In recent years single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has become widely used
for transcriptome analysis in many areas of biology. In contrast to bulk
RNA-seq, scRNA-seq provides quantitative measurements of the expression
of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data,
novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the
methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In
this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq processing, starting
from the raw reads coming off the sequencer. The course includes common
analysis strategies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss
the central biological questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq.

WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will be delivered over the course of five days. Each day will
include an introductory lecture with class discussion of key concepts. The
remainder of each day will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These
sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the
instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on your
own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise,
interpretation of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will
be done using a combination of tools installed on the attendees laptop
computer and web resources accessed via web browser.

WHO SHOULD ATTEND

This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical workers who
are analyzing scRNA-seq data. The material is suitable both for
experimentalists who want to learn more about data-analysis as
well as computational biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq
methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can be applied to any
experimental protocol or biological system.

REQUIREMENTS

The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Unix
and bash and R scripting languages.  We will also assume that you are
familiar with mapping and analysing bulk RNA-seq data as well as with
the commonly available computational tools.

EXAMPLE DATA

Attendees will learn to process, analyze, visualize and interpret results
from one of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) publicly available single
cell datasets. These datasets were generated from different organisms and
tissues. These data are representative of multiple scRNASeq protocols
and various experimental designs. They will be analyzed to determine
previously known as well as potentially novel interpretations.
