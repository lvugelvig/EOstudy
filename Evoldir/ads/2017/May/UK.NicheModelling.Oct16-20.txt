Ecological niche modelling using R (ENMR01)

Delivered by Dr. Neftali Sillero

http://www.prstatistics.com/course/ecological-niche-modelling-using-r-enmr01/

This course will run from 16th - 20th October 2017 at SCENE field 
station, Loch Lomond national park, Scotland

Applying niche modelling to the field of evolutionary biology has 
increased in recent years. It is especially important for field of 
ecological speciation, sympatric speciation, resource specialisation and 
studying how organisms and traits may evolve/cope with rapid changes to 
the environment such as those caused by climate change.

Ecological niche, species distribution, habitat distribution, or 
climatic envelope models are different names for similar mechanistic or 
correlative models, empirical or mathematical approaches to the 
ecological niche of a species, where different types of ecogeographical 
variables (environmental, topographical, human) are related with a 
species physiological data or geographical locations, in order to 
identify the factors limiting and defining the species' niche. ENMs have 
become popular due to the need for efficiency in the design and 
implementation of conservation management.

The course will cover the base theory of ecological niche modelling and 
its main methodologies. By the end of this 5-day practical course, 
attendees will have the capacity to perform ecological niche models and 
understand their results, as well as to choose and apply the correct 
methodology depending on the aim of their type of study and data.

The course will be mainly practical, with some theoretical lectures. All 
modelling processes and calculations will be performed with R, the free 
software environment for statistical computing and graphics 
(http://www.r-project.org/). Attendees will learn to use modelling 
algorithms like Maxent, Bioclim, Domain, and logistic regressions, and R 
packages for computing ENMs like Dismo and Biomod2. Also, students will 
learn to compare different ecological niche models using the Ecospat 
package.

Course content is as follows

Monday 16th
Elementary concepts on Ecological Niche Modelling
Module 1: Introduction to ENM theory. Definition of ecological niche 
model; introduction to species ecological niche theory, types of 
ecological niches, types of ENM, diagram BAM, ENMs as approximations to 
species' niches.
Module 2: Problems and limitations on ENM. Assumptions and 
uncertainties, equilibrium concept, niche conservatism, autocorrelation 
and intensity, sample size, correlation of environmental variables, size 
and form of study area, thresholds, model validation, model projections.
Module 3: Methods on ENM. Mechanistic and correlative models. Overlap 
Analysis, Biomod, Domain, Habitat, Distance of Mahalanobis, ENFA, GARP, 
Maxent, Logistic regression, Generalised Linear Models, Generalised 
Additive Models, Generalised Boosted Regression Models, Random Forest, 
Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Network.
Module 4: Conceptual and practice steps to calculate ENM. How to make an 
ENM step-by-step.
Module 5: Applications of ENM. Ecological niche identification, 
Identification of contact zones, Integration with genetical data, 
Species expansions, Species invasions, Dispersion hypotheses, Species 
conservation status, Prediction of future conservation problems, 
Projection to future and past climate change scenarios, Modelling past 
species, Modelling species richness, Road-kills, Diseases, Windmills, 
Location of protected areas.

Tuesday 17th
Prepare environmental variables and run ecological niche models with 
dismo package.
Module 6: Preparing variables. Choosing environmental data sources, 
Downloading variables, Clipping variables, Aggregating variables, 
Checking pixel size, Checking raster limits, Checking NoData, 
Correlating variables.
Module 7: Dismo practice. How to run an ENM using the R package dismo.

Wednesday 18th
Run ecological niche models with Biomod2 package and Maxent.
Module 8: Biomod2 practice. How to run an ENM using the R package 
Biomod2.
Module 9: Maxent practice. How to run an ENM using the R packages dismo 
and Biomod2 as well as Maxent software.

Thursday 19th
Compare ecological niche models with ecospat.
Module 10: Ecospat practice. Compare statistically two different 
ecological niche models using the R package Ecospat.
Module 11: Students' talks. Attendees will have the opportunity to 
present their own data and analyse which is the best way to successfully 
obtain an ENM.

Friday 20th
Run ecological niche models with your own data.
Module 12: Final practical. In this practical, the students will run ENM 
with their own data or with a new dataset, applying all the methods 
showed during the previous days.
