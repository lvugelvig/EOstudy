  ConGen 2013 - dinner by the lake

Objective: To provide training in conceptual and practical aspects of
data analysis for understanding the population and evolutionary genomics
of natural and managed populations.  Emphasis will be on next generation
sequence data analysis (RADs, exon capture, and whole genome sequence
analyses) and interpretation of output from recent novel statistical
approaches and software programs.  The course include discussions (in
a workshop like format) among young researchers (student participants)
and >10 leaders in population genomics (instructors) to help develop
our next generation of conservation and evolutionary geneticists.

Who should apply: Advanced Undergrads, Ph.D. students, post-docs,
faculty, and population biologists with a background of at least one
semester university-level course in population genetics and a course
in population ecology.  Participation will be limited to 25-30 people
allowing efficient instruction with hands-on computer exercises during
the course.  Priority will be given to persons with their own NGS data
to analyze.
