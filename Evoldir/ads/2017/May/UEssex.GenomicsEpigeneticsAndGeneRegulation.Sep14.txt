REGISTRATION OPEN!

Dear colleague,

The registration for the 'Genomics, Epigenetics and Gene Regulation
Symposium' is now OPEN. The meeting is being primarily sponsored by
the Genetics Society (UK) and co-sponsored by Wellcome Open Research
and Chromatrap. Thanks to our generous sponsors, registration is free
in a first come first served basis. Abstract submission is also welcomed
until the 2nd of June.

The 'Genomics, Epigenetics and Gene Regulation Symposium' at the
University of Essex aims to gather researchers to present their work on
this fast growing field. This one-day symposium on the 14th of September
will cover DNA-based regulation (chromatin and methylation) and RNA-based
gene regulation (regulatory RNAs). We strongly encourage submissions of
abstracts from PhD students and postdocs, as we aim to host contributed
talks from scientists at different levels in their careers.

We will also have a keynote talk by Prof. Anne Ferguson-Smith
(U. Cambridge) and three invited speakers: Prof. Tamas Dalmay (UEA),
Dr. Alessia Buscaino (Kent) and Prof. Boris Lenhard (Imperial)

Our campus is located at Wivenhoe Park, close to Colchester (Essex),
which is less than one hour away from Stansted Airport. If you require
accommodation, there are plenty of options on campus or in town.

be interested.

Best regards from the organizing committee,
