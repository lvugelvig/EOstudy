ForBio - the Scandinavian Research School in Biosystematics is
organising a training program for outgoing and incoming postdoctoral
fellows to apply for European Commission H2020 MSCA Individual
Fellowships.

The training program is open to potential outgoing and incoming fellows
from research groups in systematic biology in Scandinavia, including
systematics, taxonomy, phylogenetics, biogeography, etc. The target
group are academically-engaged senior PhD students, postdocs and junior
researchers. Including IF programs ER-ST (Standard European), ER-CAR
(Career Restart Grant), ER-SE (Society and Enterprise), ER-RI
(Reintegration), and GF (Global). We aim to have a mixed group of
incoming and outgoing fellows.

The program runs from May 19th to the submission deadline of the
H2020 MSCA-IF call on September 14th 2017. The training includes
match-making between fellows and hosts, coaching, an intensive 3-day
workshop at the Natural History Museum in Oslo, writing support, peer
review, and liaison with EU coordination offices.
