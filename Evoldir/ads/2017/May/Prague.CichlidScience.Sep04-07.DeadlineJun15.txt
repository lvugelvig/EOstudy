Cichlid Science 2017 - research meeting focused on cichlid fishes.

We would like to invite scientists to the upcoming Cichlid Science meeting
held in Prague (Czech Republic) on 4th - 7th September. The main goal of
the meeting is to bring together scientists from various research fields
studying cichlid fishes.

The previous meetings in Basel (2010), Leuven (2012), Bangor (2013) and
Graz (2015) covered wide range of aspects of cichlid biology including (but
not only) contributions on speciation, adaptive evolution, behavioural or
parasitology research, and we hope to continue the tradition.

We look forward to meeting you in Prague.
