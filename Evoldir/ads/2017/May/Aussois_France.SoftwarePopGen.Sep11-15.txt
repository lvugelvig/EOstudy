Dear colleagues,

It is our pleasure to announce that the third edition of the SSMPG 
summer school (Software and Statistical Methods for Population Genetics) 
will take place in Aussois (Savoie, France) from September 11 to 
September 15, 2017.

The aim of the summer school is to provide a comprehensive overview on 
software and statistical methods for detecting genes involved in local 
adaptation. Lecture notes and software demos will be given during the 
summer school. In addition to software demos, a data challenge will be 
organized to promote learning. By working in groups, participants will 
be asked to analyse simulated and challenging datasets. The objective is 
to find adaptive loci using the different software presented at the 
summer school.

More details about the summer school are available in the website of 
Grenoble Alpes Data Institute: https://goo.gl/sc09pA

The deadline for registration is July 28, 2017.
