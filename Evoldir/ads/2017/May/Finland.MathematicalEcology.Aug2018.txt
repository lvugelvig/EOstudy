Advance Announcement:
THE HELSINKI SUMMER SCHOOL ON MATHEMATICAL ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION 2018

Dear Colleagues,

We are glad to announce the 2018 edition of The Helsinki Summer School
on Mathematical Ecology and Evolution, an EMS-ESMTB School in Applied
Mathematics. The school will be held next year, between 19 and 26 August
2018 in Turku, Finland, and will be part of the EMS Year of Mathematical
Biology <http://euro-math-soc.eu/year-mathematical-biology-2018>.

The core program consists of five series of lectures:

Karl Sigmund (University of Vienna): Evolutionary game theory
Odo Diekmann (Utrecht University): Renewal equations in population biology
Sebastian Schreiber (University of California, Davis): Coexistence in variable environments
Ellen Baake (University of Bielefeld): Probabilistic models and ancestral processes in population genetics
Hans Heesterbeek (Utrecht University): Ecology of infectious diseases

All young researchers working in mathematical ecology can apply from all
countries, especially from Europe and the Mediterranean. The school is
aimed at graduate students of mathematics, but we also welcome students
of biology with sufficient background in mathematics, as well as advanced
undergraduates and postdocs.

The application period will start in late 2017. For
more information, see the school's webpage
