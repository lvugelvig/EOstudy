COURSE OVERVIEW

Reduced representation genome sequencing methods are revolutionizing
evolutionary analyses of non-model organisms. Several data generation
and data analysis protocols have been developed to generate thousands
of sequence variants in hundreds of individuals at relative low cost
and speed. In this course, we will introduce the different approaches
for obtaining reduced representation genome sequencing data and will
specially focus on the data analysis. We will cover all necessary steps
to obtain genome variants from short read data that are informative for
population genetics, phylogenetic and association studies.

WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will be delivered over the course of five days. Each day will
include an introductory lecture with class discussion of key concepts. The
remainder of each day will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These
sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the
instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on
your own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise,
interpretation of results will be discussed as a group.

WHO SHOULD ATTEND

This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical workers who are
generating and/or analyzing reduced representation genome sequencing data
(RAD-seq, ddRAD, 2bRAD, GBS,Â…). Examples demonstrated in this course
will involve primarily non-model organisms and examples of applications
of this data type for different purposes will be covered.

REQUIREMENTS

Attendees should have a background in biology. We will dedicate one
session to some basic and advanced Linux concepts. Attendees should
have also some familiarity with genomic data such as that arising from
NGS sequencers.
