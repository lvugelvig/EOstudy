Accommodation: Make the Most out of Austin

   Choosing the right accommodation can make all the difference in how you
   experience a meeting - how you work, how you learn, how you network,
   and how you relax.
   SMBE has secured exclusive discounted rates at the J.W. Marriott - the
   official meeting hotel - and the rooms are going fast! Once they've
   gone, we can't guarantee the rate, so please do book your accommodation
   today and rest easy.
    You can book your room directly through our registration system, even
   if you completed your registration at an earlier date. Just log back in
   to the registration system to add accommodation to your booking.
