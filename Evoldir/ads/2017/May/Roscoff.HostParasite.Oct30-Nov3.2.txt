Open Questions in Disease Ecology and Evolution: from Basic Research to 
Evolutionary Medicine
30 October -3 November 2017.

***Please note that participant slots are allocated on a first come 
first served basis and that we will stop handling applications once all 
slots are filled.***

Dear all,

Registration is still open for the next Jacques Monod Conference on the 
ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions. The conference,  
entitled  Open Questions in Disease Ecology and Evolution: from Basic 
Research to Evolutionary Medicine, will take place in Roscoff (Brittany, 
France) from the 30th of October to the 3rd of November 2017.

Please see below for the full list of invited speakers. There are 85 
other slots available.  Some will be selected for a short oral 
presentation.
