Dear Colleagues,

The field of population genetics has a remarkable tradition of being a
tight-knit and nurturing community. In order to continue to foster that
sense of community for popgen groups in the Midwest, *we are organizing the
fourth annual Midwest PopGen conference*.

The location and date this year will be Michigan State University on August
4th-5th.  The meeting will begin Friday at noon and continue to Saturday
evening with a BBQ on Friday evening.

Approximately fifteen 25-minute talks will be selected from submitted
abstracts, and there will be a poster session. The meeting will again be
trainee-oriented, so students and postdocs are especially encouraged to
present their work.  There will be prizes awarded for best poster and best
talk by a student and postdoc.

Please RSVP by July 21st by adding your name and information to the
registration list (https://goo.gl/wm0dDu).  If you would like to give an
oral presentation, submit your abstracts by July 21st to Anna Di Rienzo
<dirienzo at bsd dot uchicago dot edu>. Submitters will be notified if
their abstract is chosen for a talk by July 1st.  Accommodation advice is
also provided in a tab on the registration GoogleSheet (
https://goo.gl/wm0dDu).  We hope you can make it and that we can continue
this meeting for the population geneticists in our region!

All the best,

Gideon Bradburd, MSU
