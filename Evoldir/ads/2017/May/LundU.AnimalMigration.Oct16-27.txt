Dear all,

We like to announce that on the 16th-27th of October the two-week long
international PhD course in Ecology of Animal Migration will be held
at the Department of Biology at Lund University, Sweden. Here follows
a short overview of the course. For more information and registration,
please visit the course home page (link attached further down). Please
consider passing this to interested PhD students.

Overview

Animals move across different spatial and temporal scales either as
part of their daily life or as part of seasonal migrations to exploit
resources in the environment. Well known examples are the global scale
seasonal migrations in birds, sea turtles, fish and mammals, such as
whales and wildebeests. Also movements at smaller scales occur, such as
the vertical movements in plankton, the dispersal in soil collembolans
and movements of pollinating insects. But what are the ecological causes
and evolutionary consequences of animal movements?

During this two-week course you will get insight in a number of different
methods and approaches to study the migration of birds, insects,
fish, amphibians and mammals, ranging from experimental studies in the
laboratory to tracking long-distance migration in wild animals. Lectures
will be given by international authorities in the field as well as by
researchers in the CAnMove Group at Lund University.
