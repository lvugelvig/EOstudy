Symposium:  Biodiversity and Health
Organizers: Alexandra Muellner-Riehl, Jan Schnitzler, Ludger Wessjohann 
Keynote speaker: Nina RÃ¸nsted 

Plants and fungi play an important role in healthcare worldwide,
with about 25% of modern prescription drugs containing at least one
compound derived or patterned after substances derived from flowering
plants. With an estimated 350,000 species, angiosperms provide a rich
potential for finding new lead compounds for drug development. However,
research so far has largely focused on single species, on only a few
metabolites of medicinal importance, and/or on specific commercial
applications only, e.g. drugs, colours, aromas, or cosmetics. The aim
of this symposium is to bring together researchers who are working on
plants (and/or fungi), microrganisms and animals, and are interested
in a broader picture of chemo-biodiversity, phylogenetic relatedness,
and a biogeographic perspective. We will welcome contributions shedding
light on the distribution of chemodiversity both across taxonomic and
biogeographic scales and on the predictive power of phylogenies.
