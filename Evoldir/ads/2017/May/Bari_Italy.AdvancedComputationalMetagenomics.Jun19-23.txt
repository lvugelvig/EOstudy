*ELIXIR-IIB  Summer School in Advanced Computational Metagenomics
<https://elixir-iib-training.github.io/website/miscellaneous/metagenomics-bari-2017-description.html>*

*DEADLINES EXTENSION:*-    early registration: 19 May 2017
-    late registration: 9 June 2017

*** room availability at the UNA Hotel Regina is guaranteed only up to May
5th. People who want to attend the school can book the room at the Hotel
before the school registration deadline. For room reservation at the at the
special rate for school attendants, please send an e-mail to Stella (
stella@meeting-planner.it) within May 5th.

The school will focus on the computational aspects of metagenomics analysis
including reference databases, software and data retrieval and submission.
The investigation of microbial communities will be discussed with an
overview on real projects cases, both in ecological, clinical and nutrition
fields. During the practical sessions students will learn how to analyse
meta-barcoding and shotgun data from Next Generation Sequencing experiments
and to perform statistical inference on them.

*Target audience*

This course is aimed at researchers involved or embarking upon
bioinformatic analysis in metagenomic projects.

*During the course, you will learn about:*

Analysis of meta-barcoding sequence data;
Analysis of shotgun Metagenomics sequence data;
Functional annotation of metagenomic data;
Methods for statistical comparisons of multiple metagenomic samples.
Learning objectives

*After this course you should be able to:*

Choose and accomplish the most appropriate approach to analyse taxonomic
composition and function of your metagenomics data;
Perform metagenomic data submission and retrieval;
Use statistical tools for comparative analysis of multiple samples;
Use methods for pathway and network analysis in metagenomics projects.

A two-day workshop will precede a three-day intense training school where
experts in the field will be delivering interdisciplinary training in
computational metagenomics.

We offer three different registration options:

1. Workshop only
2. Three-day school only
3. Both events
