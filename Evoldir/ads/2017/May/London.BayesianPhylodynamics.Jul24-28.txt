Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the Taming the BEAST 2017 workshop on Bayesian
phylogenetic and phylodynamics analyses

Date: Monday 24 July - Friday 28 July 2017
Venue: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street,
London, WC1E 7HT, UK

Taming the BEAST is a workshop focused on BEAST2, an open-source software
package for Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of molecular sequences. The
workshop consists of invited talks, lectures and hands-on tutorials
by prominent experts in the field. This workshop aims at equipping
participants with the skills and core knowledge necessary to confidently
perform phylogenetic and phylodynamics analyses of their own. It is open
to scientists of any level interested in the analysis of genomic data
and molecular evolution.

Invited speakers: Alexei Drummond, University of Auckland; Nuno Faria,
University of Oxford; Oliver Pybus, University of Oxford; Tanja Stadler,
ETH Zürich; Tim Vaughan, University of Auckland; Erik Volz, Imperial
College London
