Dear all,

we have the last 4 spots left for the course " Using the Trinity Framework
for De novo Transcriptome Assembly, Annotation, and Downstream Expression
Studies https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course11/ ", 12-16 June
2017, Berlin (Germany).

 https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course11/
 https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course3/ .

Registration deadline: May 12th, 2017

Instructor: Brian Haas (Senior Computational
Biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard;
https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t12/
https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t14/ ).

Course Overview:

RNA-Seq technology has been transformative in our ability to explore
gene content and gene expression in all realms of biology, and de novo
transcriptome assembly has enabled opportunities to expand transcriptome
analysis to non-model organisms. This workshop provides an overview
of modern applications of transcriptome sequencing and popular tools
and algorithms for exploring transcript reconstruction and expression
analysis in a genome-free manner, leveraging the Trinity software
and analysis framework. Attendees will perform quality assessment of
Illumina RNA-Seq data, assemble a transcriptome using Trinity, quantify
transcript expression, leverage Bioconductor tools for differential
expression analysis, and apply Trinotate to functionally annotate
transcripts. Additional methods will be explored for characterizing the
assembled transcriptome and revealing biological findings.

Intended Audience:

This workshop is aimed primarily at biologist researchers that have basic
bioinformatics skills and are pursuing RNA-Seq projects in non-model
organisms.   Attendees will gain skills needed to successfully approach
transcriptome sequencing, de novo transcriptome assembly, expression
analysis, and functional annotation as applied to organisms lacking a
high quality reference genome sequence.

Teaching format:

The workshop will be delivered over the course of four and a half days,
with each session entailing lectures followed by practical hands-on
sessions. Most all computing will be done on the cloud and attendees
will use their own laptop computers with the Google Chrome web browser
providing all the necessary interfaces to the cloud computing environment,
including the linux command terminal.

Assumed background for the participants:

Basic experience with linux command-line execution and execution of
bioinformatics tools would be helpful. We will begin the course with
a review of basic linux commands and operations as a refresher. No
programming or scripting knowledge is required.
