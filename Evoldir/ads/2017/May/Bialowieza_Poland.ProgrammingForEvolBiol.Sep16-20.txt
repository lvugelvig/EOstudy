Registration is now open for 3rd Programming for Evolutionary Biology
Conference 16-20 Sept 2017, Bia³owie¿a, Poland

Closing date for registration is 15 July
Fee, including accommodation and meals, is 250 euro.

The Programming for Evolutionary Biology (PEB) conference brings
together biologists broadly interested in applying bioinformatic tools
to answer evolutionary and ecological questions.

It aims to serve as a platform for discussing the ongoing projects and
related bioinformatic pitfalls. The meeting consists of plenary talks
by renowned specialists in the field, contributed talks by the
participants (works in progress are more than welcome!) and workshops.

This year, we are fortunate to be joined by an outstanding list of
Plenary Speakers: Mark Blaxter from University of Edinburgh, Stuart
Baird from Czech Academy of Sciences, Katja Nowick from University of
Leipzig. The workshops will be provided by Przemys³aw Biecek, a data
scientist and R enthusiast from University of Warsaw.
