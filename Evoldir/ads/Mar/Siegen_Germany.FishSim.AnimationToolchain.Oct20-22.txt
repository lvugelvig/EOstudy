BACKGROUND
Scientists are continuously looking for new methods to improve
experimental procedures and to pave new ways to study animal
behavior. Nowadays, more and more scientists tend to use various forms
of computer animations that assist in research and lead to higher control
and standardization during experiments. Computer animations offer various
opportunities for specific manipulation of morphology and behavior of
a virtually created animal stimulus in a range not possible with live
stimulus animals. Furthermore, computer animations serve to implement
the 3Rs principle in research by replacing and reducing the use of
experimental animals and by refining experimental procedures. Currently,
researchers can choose from a conglomeration of software solutions to
create and animate 2D and 3D virtual stimuli. Nevertheless, easy-to-use
toolchains that are designed for the specific needs of behavioral
biologists and that combine all necessary steps, from creation of the
stimulus to its presentation, do nearly not exist (but see anyFish;
http://swordtail.tamu.edu/anyfish).

Within the scope of the DFG funded Virtual Fish Project at University
of Siegen (Germany), we developed the free and open-source "FishSim
Animation Toolchain" (FishSim) which combines easy creation,
animation and presentation of realistic 3D computer-animated fish
stimuli for the use in experiments with live test fish (üller et
al. 2016, doi: 10.1093/cz/zow106; Gierszewski et al. 2016, doi:
10.1093/cz/zow108). FishSim was specifically designed for behavioral
experiments using common one-choice and two-choice set-ups, as in
studies on visual signaling and mate choice. FishSim provides various
possibilities to experimentally manipulate morphology and behavior of any
number of virtual 3D fish with presentation via monitors. Since FishSim
is based on a computer game engine, it offers a unique way for animating
3D fish via real-time input from an external video-game controller.

To introduce FishSim and to assist in the implementation of our toolchain,
we would like to welcome you to join a 3-day international workshop for
behavioral and evolutionary biologists on "Discovering FishSim in 3
days - new software for computer-animated 3D fish stimuli for innovative
research in animal behavior". The workshop will be held at University
of Siegen in Siegen, Germany, from October 20-22, 2017, and is organized
by Dipl.-Biol. Stefanie Gierszewski (Institute of Biology, University
of Siegen), Prof. Dr. Klaudia Witte (Institute of Biology, University
of Siegen), Dipl.-Inform. Klaus üller (Institute of Real-Time Learning
Systems, University of Siegen) and BSc. Jan-Marco Hütwohl (Institute
of Real-Time Learning Systems, University of Siegen).

The goal of this 3-day workshop is to provide detailed information
on the free and open-source FishSim Basic and its integrated tools
FishCreator, FishSteering and FishPlayer in both theory and practice. DOs
and DON'Ts for implementation of FishSim Basic in future research are
discussed. Working computers with all software installed will be provided
but it is also possible to use personal laptops. Assistance and advice
for working with own data will be given.

APPLICATION / REGISTRATION
Any scientist in the field of fish behavior (asters and PhD
students, postdocs, senior scientists) is welcome to register for the
workshop. Registration fees (50  euro  for students, 70  euro  for postdocs
and senior researchers) include catering during the workshop as well
as a social dinner on Saturday evening (October 21st). Additional costs
will arise for travel and accommodation.

Since we will provide a computer workspace for every
participant, space is limited to 10 people. Therefore,
we would like you to fill out the application form at
https://virtualfishproject.wixsite.com/fishsim/application till Friday,
30th June 2017.  To ensure that you will get the most out of this
workshop, please give us some information on how you are planning to
use the software and which species of fish you are planning to use for
your research.

Notification of attendance will be given till Saturday, 15th July 2017.

We hope to welcome you in Siegen!

Cheers,
Stefanie
