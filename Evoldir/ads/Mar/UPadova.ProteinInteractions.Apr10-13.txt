ELIXIR-IIB, in collaboration with the University of Padova and RGS-Italy,
is pleased to inform you that the applications for the upcoming training
course on "Computational approaches to the study of protein interactions
and rational drug design" are now open.

*IMPORTANT DATES for this Course:*

*- Deadline for applications: 31st March 2017 *
*- Course date: 10-13 April 2017*

*Venue:* Campus di Biologia e Biomedicina "Fiore di Botta", University of
Padova, Via del Pescarotto, 8, Padova, IT

*Speakers*:
Prof. Alexandre Bonvin - Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, the
Netherlands
Dr. Norman Davey - University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland)
Dr. Stefano Forli - Dept. Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research
Institute, La Jolla, USA
Prof. Stefano Moro - Dept. of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences,
University of Padova, Padova, Italy

A maximum of 30 candidates will be accepted in the course. Selection will
start on March 10th, 2017 and those with an adequate profile will be
accepted immediately, especially if they come from other cities and/or
countries (to allow them to find reasonably cheap flight tickets).

*Course description:*
This workshop is aimed at students in master degree courses, PhD students
and post-doctoral researchers who are working or planning to work in the
field of protein interactions from a molecular and structural point of
view. In this workshop, participants will familiarize with docking
approaches to the study of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and
protein-small molecule interactions. Irreversible binders design using
molecular docking and computational methods to rational drug design will be
also described, as well as the functional role of the intrinsically
disordered proteins.

Should you have any question, do not hesitate to contact the ELIXIR-IIB
