Short course on the analysis of diversification rates from phylogenies:
June 22-23 on the campus of Oregon State University, to coincide with
the North American Evolution meetings (SSE/ASN/SSB) in Portland (June
23 - June 27). The workshop is funded in part by the National Science
Foundation with additional support from Oregon State University and is
co-organized by Dr. Dan Rabosky (University of Michigan) and Dr. Brian
Sidlauskas (Oregon State University). Travel awards of up to $500 per
person are available to cover participation costs.

Overview: Rates of speciation, extinction, and phenotypic evolution
vary widely across the Tree of Life and through time. This workshop will
provide theoretical background and a hands-on practicum in the analysis
of lineage diversification rates using time-calibrated phylogenetic
trees. Topics will include:

 Working with phylogenies in R
 Theoretical foundations of diversification models
 Developing your intuition for diversification models
 Using BAMM to study complex patterns of diversification rate variation on phylogenies
 Testing hypotheses about trait-dependent diversification  
 Assessing the reliability of inferences with BAMM and other methods
 Visualizing macroevolutionary dynamics on phylogenies
 Studying diversification rates on phylogenies that include fossils

Course will primarily be taught by Dan Rabosky (University of Michigan)
with contributions from several co-instructors. The course will assume
basic proficiency with the R programming/statistical environment and
some familiarity with command line interfaces. Example datasets will
be provided, but participants are encouraged to bring any phylogenetic
dataset they wish to analyze (time calibrated phylogenetic trees). A
personal laptop is essential.

Workshop participants will arrive in Corvallis (Oregon) any time on
Wednesday June 21 and we will depart for Portland on the evening
of Friday June 23, such that individuals can attend the Evolution
meeting. Shuttles offer easy transport between the Portland Airport
and OSU's campus every two hours, and housing is available at several
hotels near campus. Details regarding accommodation and transport will
be provided to successful applicants.

To apply, please send a CV and a short statement (1-2 paragraphs)
detailing your research interests, why you are interested in the course,
and your prior experience with R and phylogenetics / comparative
methods. Please email your application (or questions) to Dan Rabosky
(macroevolution.workshop@gmail.com).

Applications will be accepted until April 2, 2016, but please apply
early as spaces are limited. Target audience is graduate students and
postdocs but applications from researchers at other career stages are
welcome. Preference will be given to students with a clear interest and
research focus in phylogenetics & macroevolution.
