To All Students and Postdocs:

The graduate students and postdocs of the UF Whitney Laboratory for Marine
Bioscience invite you to our 5th Annual Science by the Shore Symposium
(formally Biology at the Beach) open to all scientific disciplines. This
event will take place all day Saturday, May 20th, at the Whitney Lab,
located in Saint Augustine, FL. Undergrads, graduate students and postdocs
from many different departments and universities in the southeast attend,
so anticipate learning from, and explaining your research to, a diverse
audience united by scientific curiosity and the beach!

Presentation formats include 10 minute and 5 minute oral presentations, a
traditional poster session, and a poster blitz (see registration website
for more details). Prizes will be awarded for the best presentations.
Registration is $25 (cash or check only the day of the event) and covers
breakfast, lunch, dinner, and fun symposium giveaways. The deadline to
register is May 6th, but attendance is limited, so please register early.

We look forward to you joining us for a fun, casual day at the beach where
we can discuss diverse research topics, engage in outdoor activities, and
get to know peers from outside our individual fields!  If you have any
questions, feel free to email me at sciencebytheshore@whitney.ufl.edu
