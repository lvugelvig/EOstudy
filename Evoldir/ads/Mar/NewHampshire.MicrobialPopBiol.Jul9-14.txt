The 2017 Microbial Population Biology Gordon Research Conference
will be held from July 9-14, 2017, at the Proctor Academy in Andover
NH, USA. The conference will bring together thought leaders from a
spectrum of disciplines to present and discuss empirical data and
theoretical concepts pertinent to the adaptive evolution of not only
microbes, but all other forms of life. The conference is still open
for registration but is filling up fast. To see the full program
of the meeting and to apply - preferably before April 1, go here:
