"Meta-analysis in ecology, evolution and environmental sciences "

This course will be delivered by Prof. Julia Koricheva who has co-edited 
"Handbook of meta-analysis in ecology and evolution" (Princeton 
University Press, 2013), the first handbook on meta-analysis written 
specially for ecologists and evolutionary biologists and Prof. Elena 
Kulinskaya.

http://www.prstatistics.com/course/meta-analysis-in-ecology-evolution-and-environmental-sciences-metr01/

This course will run from 24th - 28th July 2017 at SCENE field station, 
Loch Lomond, Glasgow

Course only and all inclusive packages are available.

This 5-day course will involve combination of lectures and practical 
sessions where students will practice conducting meta-analysis using the 
metafor package in R. In addition, students will conduct their own 
mini-meta-analyses by working in small groups on an assigned ecological 
topic with 8-10 primary research papers provided per topic. Students 
would need to decide on effect size metric to use and inclusion 
criteria, extract the data from the primary studies, design the 
extraction spreadsheet, conduct meta-analysis using the metafor package 
and present their results in the form of a PowerPoint Presentation.
After successfully completing this course students should be able to:
1) formulate questions for meta-analysis
2) formulate inclusion criteria for primary studies to be included in 
the analysis design spreadsheets for data extraction
3) conduct literature search on the topic
4) extract data from published studies
5) conduct meta-analysis using metafor package in R
6) present the results of the meta-analysis

Course content is as follows

DAY 1
-Lectures
Types of quantitative research synthesis (vote counting, combining 
probabilities, meta-analysis)
History of meta-analysis and its applications in ecology
Types of ecological data and their conversion to effect sizes
Question formulation and inclusion criteria
Literature search and data extraction
-Practical
Work in groups: students decide on inclusion criteria and metrics of 
effect size for their own meta-analysis based on 8-10 studies and begin 
data extraction

Tuesday DAY 2
-Lecture
Combining effect sizes across studies, fixed vs random effects models
Practical
Using metafor package in R to calculate effect sizes and overall mean 
effects using fixed and random effect models.
-Work in groups: completing data extraction for own meta-analysis and 
running meta-analysis.

DAY 3
-Lecture
Exploring the causes of heterogeneity in effect sizes by meta-regression
-Practical
Meta-regression analyses using metafor.
-Lecture
Dealing with non-independence of observations (including phylogeny bias)
-Practical
Work in groups: testing for moderators, considering sources of 
non-independence.

DAY 4
-Lecture
Publication bias
Statistical methods for bias detection
-Practical
Exploring publication and related biases in metafor
-Lecture
Dealing with missing data and variable research quality
Format of meta-analysis report: good and bad examples, critique of 
meta-analysis
-Practical
-Work in groups: testing for bias in own dataset; finalizing analyses;
preparing Power Point presentation with results of the analyses

DAY 5
-Morning
Student presentations on the results of their analyses + Discussion
-Afternoon
Individual consultations for students planning to do meta-analysis in 
their own research projects
