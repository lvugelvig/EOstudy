Genetic Analysis of Mendelian and Complex Disorders 19-25 July 2017

Finalapplications and bursary requests are now invited for this popular
Wellcome Trust Advanced Course held on the Wellcome Genome Campus,
in Hinxton near Cambridge UK. Deadline for applications: 24 March 2017.

Formerlyknown as Human Genome Analysis: Genetic Analysis of Multifactorial
Diseases, the 2017 Genetic Analysis of Mendelian and Complex Disorders
course is aimed at scientists actively involved in genetic analysis of
both rare (Mendelian) and complex human traits. The course provides a
broad and comprehensive overview of the statistical methods currently used
to map disease susceptibility genes in human populations. The programme
includes lecture and practical computer-based sessions and will discuss
fundamental issues needed to increase success in gene mapping studies,
including: Optimal study design, Power to detect linkage and association,
Determining the most appropriate statistical methods and software,
Quality control strategies, Interpretation of statistical results and
trouble shooting, Basic principles of statistical inference, Hypothesis
testing, and Population and quantitative genetics
