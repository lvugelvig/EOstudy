Dear all,

Registration is now open for the next Jacques Monod Conference on the 
ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions. The conference,  
entitled  Open Questions in Disease Ecology and Evolution: from Basic 
Research to Evolutionary Medicine, will take place in Roscoff (Brittany, 
France) from the 30th of October to the 3rd of November 2017.

Please see below for the full list of invited speakers. There are 85 
slots available for non-invited participants, some of which will be 
selected for a short oral presentation.

Please use this URL for more info and instructions on how to apply:

Looking forward to seeing you in Roscoff!
