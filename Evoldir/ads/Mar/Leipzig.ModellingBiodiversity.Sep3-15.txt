The German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research Halle-Jena-Leipzig
(iDiv) invites PhD students to apply to its third summer school taking
place from the 3rd to 15th of September 2017 in Leipzig, Germany. The
summer school gives 20 young scientists and five local doctoral
researchers the opportunity to conduct a biodiversity synthesis project
under the tutoring of senior iDiv scientists, aiming at the submission
of the work for publication. The programme combines training in synthesis
methods, plenary lectures on integrative biodiversity research, hands-on
collaborative work in small groups, and networking with biodiversity
scientists at iDiv. A varied social programme is organized together with
the iDiv doctoral researchers. The lead teacher of the summer school
is Nico Eisenhauer, iDiv Professor and head of the research group
Experimental Interaction Ecology. Other lecturers and tutors include
senior iDiv staff and invited scientists. The summer school invites
applications mainly from PhD students working on biodiversity topics,
but also applications from advanced masters level students will be
considered. A limited number of travel grants are offered to candidates
with limited resources. Applications from the developing countries,
in particular female applicants, are strongly encouraged.

Application deadline for the course is Tuesday, 2nd of May 2017.
