"Genetic data analysis/exploration using R" (GDAR03)

This course will be delivered by Dr. Thibaut Jombart who authors the
adegenet package and Dr. Zhian Kamvar.

This course will run from the 23rd - 27th October at Margam discovery 
centre
in Wales, United Kingdom.

Course Overview:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to exploratory
statistical methods used in population genetics and molecular ecology.
Participants will become proficient in a range of approaches for 
uncovering
genetic structures from usual genetic data including most genetic 
markers
(e.g. microsatellites, SNPs, AFLP) and genetic sequences (DNA or amino-
acid). After covering different types of phylogenetic reconstruction, 
and
basic population genetics tests, a strong emphasis will be put on using
factorial methods (e.g. Principal Component Analysis) for investigating
genetic diversity. In particular, we will focus on the identification 
and
description of genetic clusters, and on characterising spatial genetic
patterns. The last day of the course will be an open problem day, where
participants will be able to analyse their own data.

Day 1
Intro to phylogenetic reconstruction.
Module 1a: Reconstructing phylogenies from genetic sequence data. Three
main approaches covered: distance-based phylogenies; maximum parsimony; 
and
likelihood-based approaches.
Module 1b: Short R refresher.
Practical 1: Phylogenetic reconstruction using R. Three main approaches
plus rooting a tree; assessing/testing for a molecular clock; and
bootstrapping.
Main packages: ape, phangorn.

Day 2
Intro to multivariate analysis of genetic data
Module 2: Key concepts in multivariate analysis. Focus on using 
factorial
methods for genetic data analysis.
Practical 2: Basics of multivariate analysis of genetic data in R. 
Topics
include: data handling, population genetic tests of population structure
(PCA, PCoA).
Main packages: adegenet, ade4, ape.

Day 3
Exploring group diversity
Module 3: Approaches to identifying and describing genetic clusters. 
Topics
include: hierarchical clustering, K-means, population-level multivariate
analysis (between-group-PCA, DA, DAPC).
Practical 3: Applying the approaches covered in morning lecture and
emphasising their strengths and weaknesses.
Main packages: adegenet, ade4.

Day 4
Spatial genetic structures
Module 4: Discussing the origin and significance of spatial genetic
patterns, and how to test for them.
Practical 4: Visualising and analysing spatial genetic data. Topics:
spatial density estimates, Moran/Mantel tests, mapping principal 
components
in PCA, spatial PCA.
Main packages: adegenet, adehabitat, ade4.

Day 5
Using R for reproducible science.
Module 5: Using R for reproducible science
Practical 5: Practical session based on morning lecture
Main packages: knitr, Sweave, rmarkdown
