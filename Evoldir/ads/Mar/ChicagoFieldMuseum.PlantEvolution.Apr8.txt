Chicago Plant Science Symposium 2017
The Field Museum
*Saturday April 8, 2017 *
*10:00 AM - 7:00 PM*

We are pleased to announce the seventh year of the annual Chicago Plant 
Science Symposium. This series is designed bring together the plant 
science community of the greater Chicago area for a one day symposium 
that highlights the cutting edge of research in plant evolution, 
ecology, and conservation. The program will include lunch and a 
post-conference mixer. Best of all, registration is free!

The theme of the symposium this year is *"Genomic insights into plant 
ecology and evolution"*. We have invited a diverse set of speakers 
representing a wide range of research fields that are benefitting from 
the application of these new technologies and analytical methods.
