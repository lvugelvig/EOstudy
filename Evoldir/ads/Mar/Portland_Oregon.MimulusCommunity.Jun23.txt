Dear Community

An International Mimulus meeting will be held June 23rd, just prior to the
Evolution Meeting in Portland, OR. The meeting will be located at Portland
State University. Thanks to Matt Streisfeld and Mitch Cruzan for securing a
room for us!!!!

For details of the meeting, please see the website.

As our community continues to grow, we need to adjust the meeting format
accordingly. Instead of research talks, like previous meetings, we will
instead have presenters that will summarize advances in Mimulus research
over the last few years. We will also focus the afternoon part of the
meeting on community building and organization. We will send out more
details soon on how this will all work, but community input will be crucial
for success. So that we can send you updates, we encourage registration for
meeting ASAP, even if you are not sure if you can come:
