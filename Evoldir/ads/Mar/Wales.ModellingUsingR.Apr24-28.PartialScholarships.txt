We still have 'normal' places available for anyone else interested.

Full course details are given below

http://www.prstatistics.com/course/advancing-statistical-modelling-using-r-advr06/

This course will run from 24th - 28th April at Margam Discovery 
Centre,
Wales.

This is an introduction to model selection and simplification, 
generalised linear models, mixed effects models and non-linear models.

The course is aimed at biologists with a basic to moderate knowledge in 
R. The course content is designed to bridge the gap between basic R 
coding and more advanced statistical modelling. This five day course 
will consist of series of modules, each lasting roughly half a day and 
comprised of lectures and practicals designed to either build required 
skills for future modules or to perform a family of analyses that is 
frequently encountered in the biological literature.

Course content is as follows

Day 1 Course introduction
-	Techniques for data manipulation, aggregation, and visualisation; 
introduction to linear regression. Packages: {tidyr}, {dplyr}, {ggplot2}

Day 2 Linear models
-	Diagnostics, collinearity, scaling, plotting fitted values); fitting 
and interpreting interaction terms; model selection and simplification; 
general linear models and ANCOVA.
-	Packages: {stats}, {car}

Day 3 Generalized linear models
-	Logistic and Poisson regression; predicting using model objects and 
visualizing model fits.
-	Packages: {broom}, {visreg}, {ggplot2}

Day 4 Mixed effects models
-	Theory and practice of mixed effect models; visualising fixed and 
random effects.
-	Packages: {lme4}, {broom}, {ggplot2}, {sjPlot}

Day 5 Fitting nonlinear functions
-	Polynomial & Mechanistic models; brief introduction to more advanced 
topics & combining methods (e.g., generalised linear mixed effects, 
nonlinear mixed effects, and zero-inflated and zero-altered models).
-	Packages: {nlsTools}.
-	Afternoon to discuss own data if time permits
or visit our website www.prstatistics.com

Please feel free to distribute this material anywhere you feel is
suitable.
