DESCRIPTION
Sexual selection is expected to promote population fitness by enhancing
the reproductive success of individuals of high genetic quality (i.e. of
high breeding value for fitness), or by purging the genome of deleterious
mutations, e.g. via mate preferences for condition-­dependent traits or
dominance fights within sexes. The significance of such effects is not
sufficiently understood yet. Estimates range from minor importance to
the benefits of sexual selection even outweighing the costs of sex. We
will discuss the problem in the context of current environmental changes
and the potential of rapid evolution.
