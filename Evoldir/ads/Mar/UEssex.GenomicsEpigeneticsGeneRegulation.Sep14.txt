Dear colleagues,

The 'Genomics, Epigenetics and Gene Regulation Symposium' at the 
University of Essex aims to gather researchers to present their work on 
this fast growing field. This one-day symposium on the 14th of September 
will cover DNA-based regulation (chromatin and methylation) and 
RNA-based gene regulation (regulatory RNAs). We strongly encourage 
submissions of abstracts from PhD students and postdocs, as we aim to 
host contributed talks from scientists at different levels in their careers.

We will also have a keynote talk by Prof. Anne Ferguson-Smith (U. 
Cambridge) and three invited speakers: Prof. Tamas Dalmay (UEA), Dr. 
Alessia Buscaino (Kent) and Prof. Boris Lenhard (Imperial)

Our campus is located at Wivenhoe Park, close to Colchester (Essex), 
which is less than one hour away from Stansted Airport. If you require 
accommodation, there are plenty of options on campus or in town.

For more information visit our webpage:

Registration is free. Abstracts will be accepted for submission from the 
3rd of April until the 2nd of June.

Please share this information with your colleagues and/or anyone that 
may be interested.

Best regards from the organizing committee,

Antonio Marco
