Dear Dr. XXNAME,

As part of the Equal Opportunity Initiative of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), we are currently investigating the potential factors affecting the proportion of invited female speakers in scientific events advertised on the Evoldir mailing list.

We saw the post about the XXEVENTTYPE that you organize, and we would like to ask if you could answer a very short questionnaire, available at 
XXQADDRESS ; 
filling it in should take no more than 2 minutes.

We thank you in advance for your time.
Please feel free to contact us should you have any question.

Best wishes,

Flo Debarre, Nicolas Rode, Shermin de Silva, Line Ugelvig.
